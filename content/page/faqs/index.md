## What are the different types of climbing?

- **Free climbing**: the climber uses only natural rock features to make upwards progress.
- **Aid climbing**: the climber places equipment in the wall, and then pulls himself upwards with this equipment.

Free climbing exists in many forms:
- **Bouldering**: no ropes, crash pads to land on
- **Top roping**: roped, one person belays the climber using a rope fixed through the top of the wall.
- **Lead**: roped, the climber clips the rope into the wall as they climb up.
- **Sport**: outdoor lead climbing. The climber places quickdraws on bolts fixed in the rock, and clips his rope to the quickdraws.
- **Trad (traditional)**: outdoor lead climbing, but (generally) without fixed gear in the wall. The climber places nuts, hexes and cams (+ more exotic gear) in the rock and clips his rope in.
- **Winter**: trad climbing, with ice axes and crampons in cold environments.
- **Alpine**: light and fast winter climbing, used for larger objectives where speed is key.
- **Big Wall**: multi-day ascents, can be done as free or aid climbing.
