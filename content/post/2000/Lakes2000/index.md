Lake District with Sunshine and Climbing. Not the combination expected, well climbing on slate in
the Lake District was the plan; the sunshine was an added extra. Despite much debate on the way up
north, the intended induction into 'Hollies' was missed due to no-one being sure where it was, until
it was decided we had missed it, so Burger King had to suffice.

Eventually we reached the Hut. The good thing about Huts/Barns, (or any permanent structure with
four walls and a roofâ€¦apart from saving the hassle of blundering around in the dark putting tents
up. (why are torches always at the bottom of the bag) is the better facilities, often mattresses as
opposed to hard ground, and basic cooking facilities. The other advantage is decent toilets
especially according to one member who when going to the loo asked 'can I have a torch as I can't
see shit in the toilet' apparently he meant that he was having difficulty finding the light switch.

Saturday started as usual with those first awake eventually facing everybody to get a move on, but
where? The previous nights plans of early morning climbs were lost, as we departed for Keswick
and a tea shop, followed by finding lunch at the bakery next door as the sandwiches we had each
bought did not compare to the pasties and buns on offer.

The crag on the first day had a good slab, for the more recent converts to outdoors climbing to use
their new gear from a recent 'cheap gear day'. Whilst for those more experienced there were more
challenging routes as well. The crag also had the rare distinction of being sheltered at the bottom,
and in bright sunlight at the top. You cannot beat that! Coupled with the views down the valley to
snow capped mountains. The days climbing was only curtailed by the loss of light, so we decamped
to Keswick, and the chip shop, for tea.

A pub a short walk from the hut provided the evening's entertainment, with what can only be
described as a comprehensive selection of whiskeys on view, for those who wanted to try something
different. The room at the hut continued to provide amusement, the roof beam providing a further
challenge, as all comers failed to, from hanging underneath, go round over the top of the beam.

Sunday initially provided more of the same again starting with a (regulation?) tea room and bakery
visit, and then moving on to the Bowder Stone, a huge bolder deposited by glaciers, and providing
problems for those who wanted something different. The crag on the way to the boulder offered a
variety of routes, which kept us amused all day. The day again finished as it got dark, and so began
the long journey south back to the smoke. However a treat was in store. This time the deliberation
started early enough that we managed to find Hollies transport cafe, for the culinary experience of
the trip. Better by far even than bargain deals of 12 pasties for price of 10, or even teacakes and
hot-cross buns. The service may not have been with a smile, but the servings were big, and cheap.
We soon replaced any fat we had burnt off over the weekend, some even thinking a mixed grill was
justified.
