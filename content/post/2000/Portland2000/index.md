An all together fantastic trip involving two breaking-in's (don't panic...someone only climbed
through the windows of a) the caravan and b) the mini bus.) the rather unfair exclusion of a very
authentic and rustic looking ice pick, much to someone's utter dismay... ...the full novelty of the
mini bus roof rack (inclusive of very useful ladder up the back of the bus to enable a quick and easy
transfer of self from very back of bus to front windscreen preferably of the same mini bus from
which you started from...if not then the fast flowing motorway below...) motorcyclists also had the
extra bonus of the back door opening as they would try and pass us on the motorway...


There was also the amazing discovery of a 'bouncy castle' in someone's, rather foolishly, unguarded
back garden...and the shock discovery of a whole live frog!!!! And the same person who discovered
all these amazing things also cunningly managed to turn (by a feat of PURE skill) everything that
she touched black and glittery... The caravans were fantastic, apart from the cleaning that had to be
done the next morning...


Although the Saturday's climbing weather was well behaved, giving an excellent days climbing
Sunday was impeded by rain, which also led to fabulous 'sudden' decisions to have 'rests' during
climbs. Coupled with people's sudden and unexplained attraction to the ground. The followed by an
even more spectacular climb back up a steep, muddy, bramble lined walk to the mini bus. The keys
to which had gone on a little adventure all of their own...
Everyone made it back in one piece, and no one had left and bags anywhere (especially in Beit
Quad...)
