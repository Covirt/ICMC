An excellent weekend of climbing was had by everybody on the trip spoilt only slightly by the
onset of rain, snow, sleet and enormous amounts of wind on Sunday. For about half the members
attending this was their first time climbing outside; the first half of Saturday was spent
introducing them to safe gear placement, belaying with two ropes and how to set up an anchor.

The usual lunch of jam, chocolate spread and peanut butter sandwiches, was followed by more
climbing with people trying grades ranging from severe to E2 and everything inbetween. More
people went bouldering in the afternoon and once again the club was climbing into the dark!

A late night watching men pull buses and Die Hard 2 was followed on Sunday morning by a
brief spell of climbing before rain and wind forced us to run back to the bus. Kip drove us home
after lunch in the bus and we arrived early enough to pop into the union before it shut.
