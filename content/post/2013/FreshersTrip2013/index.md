All is well that ends well. It is as they say!

This Fresher’s trip to the peak district started exceptionally strong, as we
meant to go on, with two minibuses ram packed full of keen climbers, new and
old, all raring to put one hand above the other in the name of increasing
potential energy. After being enticed by our fantastic exhibition of excellence,
intelligence and outright debauchery at fresher’s fair, the eager early members
stared through misty windows with bright eyes as we escaped the flashing city
lights in the crimson of the setting sun and made haste for the silence of the
north. Silence that was soon to be broken.

We arrived in excellent time to the cold and familiar greetings that the
unheated town hall we so often frequent had to offer. That and a thick
downpour of rain.

Yes, the rumours from the men and women on the TV who love to smile and
tell us we are to enter times of great sorrow, bleakness and sideways rain were
true: 60% of the time, it rains all the time. But to those individuals on a


£22,000 salary[1], we laughed, and said “ICMC eats misfortune and adversity
for blunner (Breakfast, lunch and dinner all in one meal for people who do not
have the time to eat[2])”.

The consumption of alcohol was neither encouraged nor condemned, as
underlined by the new union rules regarding drinking in societies™©®. When
people’s lips became dry in the harsh and cold winter weathers that so often
swallow the peaks, we supplied necessary liquids in a variety of flavours, to
combat such life threatening signs, with utmost vigilance and urgency.

The morning trundled lazily over the rolling hills of northern countryside that
came in the form of pounding and wet rain. 2-0 meteorologists.

In no particular haste the most spectacular scent of real life pork meat and
some-what eggs was sent in to the bedding chambers that housed at least 30
hungry individuals and caused a stir. The breakfast was expertly prepared by
fresh president of all things metal and fabric, Ben Coope, with trusty assistants
Tim Seers, Will Will Smith-Cloud and Jordan. YOU MUST CONSTRUCT
ADDITIONAL PYLONS.

After the small council met to decide the outcome of the day, two groups spit
up; one visited the bouldering mecca known as the works, and the other to lay
eyes upon the fantastic new Awesome Walls. Walls that outshone any lead
walls for many miles. Rock climbing was out of the question, so plastic would
have to suffice.

Those at the works also had the option to do a spot of celebrity spotting and
even climb a bit with them as Leah Crane, Dianne Merrick and Ned the baker
were there. They were strong, we weren’t wrong.

Cooking chilli and exploring the psychological benefits of becoming a socialite
and actually having a great conversation with people you’d never met.
Everyone did so wonderfully.

Carrots were, as laid down in the ICMC rules, regulations and traditions, “less
than tender”.

Every passing hour from 11PM to 7PM seemed to merge in to one giant
concoction of uncertainty, spontaneity and fun, perhaps with a few missing
items of minor clothing splayed throughout the hall. Most people knew where,
less what, and very few when it happened. But regarding the who, everyone
was certain.

Sunday followed the exact same proceedings, pretty much to the letter, as we
became doomed to a life of London climbing. That is to say, on plastic.

This did not deter the newer members, whose wide-eyes still glistened with
straight up keenness and psyche to pull. It was from this point on that the
older members knew that these freshers were ready to join the leagues of
ICMC members, and refresh the generation.

We eat hard, and climb lard.
