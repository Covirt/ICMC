## First day - Friday (8th March 2013)

17:41 – and the bus is off! Fully packed and we only forgot the map and first
aid kit. Our impressive start was only foiled slightly by traffic jams and we
managed to make it to Milkins’ house by midnight. Luxurious conditions were
experienced by all, mostly Ruth and Rosanna who were assigned a ‘girls’ room

Murray declined his invitation. Ben, Sam and Will couldn’t decide which of
them should be thrown out of the double bed and had an uncomfortable night’s
sleep with minimal spooning.

## Second day – Saturday

6:15 – porridge making begins! Blinkers were put on by all trip attendees with
possibly the quickest departure ever for a morning... all in vain as by the time
we got to Brimham Rocks (after a brief pause to remove a bag of sick [courtesy
of Andy Moore] from the bus) it was snowing sideways and the rock could have
been described as ‘a bit damp’.


Milkins climbed a stream (VDiff) whilst everyone else had a walk around
and a bit of a boulder on the 2m of dry wall. After an hour or so the decision
was made to go to The Depot indoor bouldering wall in Leeds. Much fun was
had by all and we met up with Alumni! Then went to the pub. Tasty chilli was
made in record time ready for the evening premier – ‘Vertical Limit’ a highly
accurate documentary about mountain rescue.


## Third day – Sunday

After the overly keen wake up time and late bed time Ruth decided to have
a lie in (07:30), but we still managed to have a highly efficient departure with
the bouldering pads being loaded onto the roof (controversial and effective) no
one was sick on the way to the crag! Almscliff offered dry rock, snow flurries
and occasional sunshine with first leads from Sietse who found some amusing
gear placements (in a good way) and Harry who found a place for Bens big
cam (size5?); Jakov and Rosanna learning how to lead belay with halves; Kip
pretending to be a seal (see photo) and getting hot aches;

Tim successfully leading the famous Yorkshire grade of MVS; Davie, Ben, Ali
and Will doing some hard bouldering (some Joeling involved);Phil, Nicolau and

Sam getting some routes in (Ruth checking gear/anchors); Murray and Johan
getting some trad on with Murray having to break through the ice in a puddle to
top out a rather tricky looking route at the end of the day. The drive home was
relatively uneventful with some unexpected snow driving around Derby, pizzas
in Lugabaruga arriving back in the union for 12:15.

Thanks to everyone for coming on this trip, it was a pleasure to run.
