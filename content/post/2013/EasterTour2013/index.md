# ICMC Easter Tour: ~~Fontainebleau~~ Wales


24th March - 1st April 2013

The trip got off to a good start with everyone
turning up on time at Beit. The car and bus
were packed and we set off to Wales via a
Sainsburys at around 2pm. We arrived at the
hut hassle free, at about 11pm. The next day
marked the first day of climbing. With the
LLanberis pass being closed, going to
Tramadog had to be cancelled and instead
an attempt was made to climb some of the
boulders at the roadside crag in the
Cromlech. Here it was very cold and windy
so the party quickly bailed into the bus stop quarry for a spot of easy sport
climbing.

Day 2 saw successful passage to Tramadog and the first day of trad
climbing. Novices were introduced to the world of multi pitch trad,
climbing with more experienced members of the trip. A pleasant time was
had by all, pootling up some HS’s. Meanwhile the boulderers were
climbing around the Bustach boulders
with Will climbing his first V7. Once
everyone had reconvened at
Tremadog, the bus took people back to
the hut and the car took some
boulderers off to Elephantitus for an
evening session seeing a few more
hard sends.

Day 4 was a rest day spent wandering
about gear shops and staring at rocks
from a distance.

Day 5 split the tour into sport climbers and boulderers. The sport climbers
were dropped off at the Castle Inn and the boulderers found themselves
the cave. Everyone had a good day enjoying yet another improbably dry
day. The boulderers suffered defeats across the board and vowed to return
to finish projects.

Day 6 was a return to the Cromlech where Jo eventually sent her first V
but in general it was too cold for most people. That evening we retired to
Ben’s house in southern Snowdonia as the hut became unavailable. Thefollowing day was sent resting, biking and slack lining here in secluded
central wales.

Day 8 again split the tour, the sport
climbers dropped at Penmaen Head
where Milkins sent his first 6b outdoors.
The boulderers returned to battle in the
cave with partial success. Jack just missed
out on his V9 project, Jordan sent Clever
Beaver V7, Chris climbed something hard
and Ben sent his first V9, Rock Atrocity. All
in all a respectable tick list.

Day 9 was our last, making it back to Beit by 9:30pm.

Overall the trip was a success, especially as the destination had to be
changed at such short notice due to the lack of drivers. The trip was very
cheap and we made the most of very fortunate weather. All the novices
were introduced to multi pitch trad climbing and the trip maintained a
relaxed feeling. Honourable mention to Chris, without his solo bus driving effort,
the trip would not have been possible.

## Finances
The trip cost a total of £1031.79, travel cost a total of £686.08 which is less than
was originally budgeted for so only £257.28 of the funding was calculated as
37.5% of the travel cost of the trip. The trip then cost members a total of £
each.
These figures are before the Union’s retrospective moderation.

## Difficulties & Objectives
Due to mass drop out of drivers in the closing stages of organising the tour, the
trip was almost cancelled but instead was rapidly switched to Wales at the last
minute. This lead to the tour being, initially, quite disorganised. However, given
the circumstances, the trip went as well as can be expected; with Christopher
Hunt offering to do all of the driving and Benjamin Coope donating the use of his
car. We managed to climb every day that we weren’t resting, there were no injuries and everyone had a great time. All the novices gained experience in
climbing outdoors and the trip was run to the slimmest of budgets.
