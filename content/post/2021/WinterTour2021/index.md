## Background

In direct contrast to the South-East of England, Scotland is a rugged and geologically varied country
and plays host to some of the oldest mountains in the world. With such an expansive mountainous
environment, some of the most pivotal figures in British mountaineering history have been Scots, such
as Harold Raeburn and Sir Hugh Munro (the namesake of Scottish peaks exceeding 3,000 feet).

Scotland’s proximity to maritime and continental polar weather fronts increases the incidence of
colder weather and snowfall, with the mountainous regions such as the Cairngorms and Grampian
mountains receiving the most, this leads to consistent wintery conditions on the high mountains of
Scotland. As such, technical winter climbing utilizing crampons, ice axes, and traditional climbing
methods is a common seasonal activity drawing people from across the UK and Europe. Recreational
Scottish winter climbing goes
back as far as the 1870s with the
first ascents of the major gullies
on the North face of Ben Nevis,
however, it would be another
two decades until the first
documented ascent of the ultra-
classic Tower Ridge (IV,3) in 1894. 

Compared to the
Grampians, the northern
Cairngorms were delayed in
their recreational exploration
with significant development
only occurring after the turn of
the century. Despite this, the
audacity of the climbers and
(fortunately) success only
accelerated, outpacing the
development of mountaineering
equipment, achieving impressive
first ascents such as Point Five
Gully (V, 5) and Orion Face Direct
(V, 5), both of which are
challenging climbs by modern
standards, one can only think of
the harrowing experience and
grave risks that the early
mountaineers exposed
themselves to. The year 1970
brought about massive
change, with the visit of
legendary American rock
climber Yvon Chouinard bringing the first curved ice axes to the UK, and with their arrival, the limits
were further pushed, and the sport further increased in popularity.

With the development of the sport throughout the 70s and 80s, the state of the sport started to look
more and more like the predecessor to modern winter climbing. With the increased accessibility to,
and media surrounding modern high-altitude mountaineering, mountaineering, alpinism, and winter
climbing have become more popular than ever, with the mountains of Scotland serving as a valuable
training ground for young, up-and-coming alpinists.

Imperial College Mountaineering Club holds a winter climbing meet in the Cairngorms every year, with
such skills and experience gained serving as the steppingstones for members to conquer greater
objectives, such as student-run expeditions to Alaska’s Alaska Range, and the Monte Rossa Massif in
recent years. This trip aims to continue this long history of developing mountaineering skills.

## Itinerary 

### Day 1 - Fireside tales 28/12/

A mild London morning greeted us, our recent Christmas festivities were still fresh in our minds,
however, those snow-free memories were being quickly replaced with the thought of snow-dusted
Scottish valleys, rime-ice-covered rocks, and Icey gullies, but this was not to be the case. The 12 - hour
trip was long but never boring, interspersed with stories of winter’s past and our autumnal epics
hoping to replicate ICMC’s recent success on trips and be greeted with good weather. Psyche was
building the closer we got to the Scottish border, with Jerry Springer and Paolo Nutini creeping their
way onto the car stereo with greater frequency, with our Scottish music cultural dive only being
interrupted by news from the other car – Olly’s good old unreliable van. Packed with mission-critical
gear, Olly and his co-pilot Issy were unsure if there were going to make it to the Cairngorm car park in
anything other than a RAC recovery vehicle. Their vehicle was stricken with intense vibrations,
however, with only a short wait, the good Samaritan from the RAC fixed the fault which has resulted
from the ineptitude of a previous unnamed mechanic, as the front left wheel was not properly
attached. That was the last of days’ dramas, with everyone making it to the hut by the early hours of
the morning. Upon arrival, equipment was distributed, with Jake taking the fancy of a short ice screw
he affectionately named ‘shtubby’, whilst others were fixated on the ancient human ritual of fire
lighting.

### Day 2 Route Recon 29/12

The group awoke with a
pre-dawn start, a theme
that persisted until the end
of the trip. With a mix of
experience within the
group, members with
winter climbing experience
(Ciaran, Olly, Piers, and
Jake) were to go to the
northern corries of Stob
Coire an t-Sneachda and
Cairn Lochan to access
conditions, whilst those
that didn’t (Alex, Issy, George, Ben) started a 2 - day introductory course ran by Ronald ‘Ron’ Walker, a local legend of the area. Ron is a naturally gifted and successful winter climber, with decades of
experience, with outstanding local knowledge to guide clients, and is a keen photographer with many
of his wintery shots filling the SMC guidebooks. With the groups splitting up, the learners received an
excellent course on winter mountaineering basics, cruising the class and exceeding expectations,
however, the same could not be said for the other group. Equipped with fully laden packs, reminiscent
of those used for the siege tactics of the early alpinists. After brushing up on rusty winter skills
including personal movement and ice axe arrests, they continued walking around to Lochan.
Unfortunately, both Sneachda and Lochan had been stripped of snow and ice by the recent high-
pressure system that was stubbornly refusing to leave Scotland at the time. The group was
disappointed, however, with Jake’s father and his Met Office connections we were informed that a
strong low-pressure system was coming soon. Such shifting conditions were on-theme for the season
so far, with the Scottish weather largely not cooperating with the needs of the many eager early-
season senders. Winds were picking up, with a yellow wind warning for the entire mountain range,
but the group was keen to not let the day go to waste. With the winds making any walk up to the
Cairngorm plateau too dangerous and frankly too miserable, we set our sights on a smaller peak
located North-East of Cairngorm – Castle hill. Standing at only 728 meters, its unimpressive height
camouflages it in the rugged background of the range, the only thing more unimpressive, was the
difficulty of ascending it that day. Cutting to the peaks’ south, with the wind behind them, the group
made the last ascent to the summit with 60mph winds physically lifting them up the entire way. With
such winds, Jake and Piers were initially blown past the summit, with Ciaran and Olly having to stand
aggressively leaning into the so that they didn’t tumble down the West side of the hill. With the day
thoroughly seized, the now wind-battered team regrouped with the novices in Aviemore for chips and
deep-fried haggis before heading back to the hut, pondering the potential events of the next day.

### Day 3 - Chasing Phantoms 30/12

Overnight, the weather had turned. High winds had given
way to torrential showers high on the Munros. Ron opted to
push the second day of teaching back to the next day, and
with the group wanting to make the most of their time in the
mountaineering capital of the UK, we headed for the
Cummingston on the sun-baked eastern coast.
Cummingston, with a microclimate that typically opposes
that of the inner mountains of Scotland, is a wet weather
venue where one can retreat to for coastal sea cliff single-
pitch trad climbing. However, our bad luck continued, the
venue was thoroughly soaked with even the supposedly
‘weatherproof’ cave dripping wet. We regrouped at the car
park with the group only given one last potential objective –
the Cummingston car park playground. It contained
legendary rides including the spinning top, giant roundabout,
and the UKC checklist-approved gem of ‘the crag’ the _Metal
Slide on the approach to Cummingston_ Grade – I. Jake, with
his low center of mass and strong bouldering background,
flashed the problem, pinching the sides of the metal slide and
brute forcing his way to the top. Piers, having been
unsuccessful during his previous visits attempted the same, however, it was not to be, and Piers was forced to console his failure on the other rides. Though if
asked, he would never admit it, it was Piers’ highlight of the trip.

By now, word has spread amongst the group of a mythical truly weatherproof venue - Cauldron Rocks.
Located in Findhorn Gorge and only a short drive South-West of Cummingston, we made haste to the
crag to maximize the short winter day. Upon arrival, it became apparent that lacking a local map,
accurate approach notes, and – for some – a sense of direction that the crag would be almost
impossible to find. The group, led by George and Ben descended the correct gorge and eventually
found the unassuming boulders, but surprise surprise, they too were wet. Defeated, the group made
for the car park only to stop and for Olly and Ciaran to climb an impressive tree that would make for
a high-quality bivvy spot high off of the forest floor. With the rest of the group thoroughly impressed
and in need of chalk for our sweaty palms, we headed home, picking up Isaac on the way from
Aviemore station.

### Day 4 - Fingers Ridge Fools 31/12

The fourth day started with the group splitting for the last time, the novices would complete their final
day of training with Ron, whilst the other 5 would ascend the highest mountain in the range – Ben
Macdui. With air temperature approaching double digits, and the rain thoroughly stripping all but the
deepest of gullies of their snow, the group used the approach to assess the damage in Sneachda and
see if anything had survived. Walking to the base of the corrie, and ascending the goat track to the
plateau, the group was amazed to see a fully kitted up party roping up to attempt _Fingers Ridge (IV 5)_
with the route being so bear, not even Page 3 would consider exploiting its currently naked state for
individual gain. Olly mentioned the complete disregard for ethics, however, the rest were too
absorbed in ascending the goat track, for it was the first time most has donned crampons and axes in
over a year. Once on the plateau, the team made quick work of walking to the summit of Ben Macdui, only stopping for the tourist pastime of summit photos, and trying to glissade down the northern
slopes by any means. With the visibility becoming worse, the quintet hastened their descent to the
car park, taking the western path down Lochan, with Ciaran setting an unachievable pace that the
others could not match. The reason for such pace was not his concern for the safety of the party due
to the hazardous low visibility, but his concern for the safety of his underwear. The pace of his descent
was so impressive that we believed it was a new speed record for a running (interspaced with
waddling) descent of Ben Macdui to the Cairngorm Car Park toilets.

The entertainment continued during the car ride back to the hut, with Olly – a concerned
environmentalist – taking to the UKC forums to ethical shortcomings of the punters we had seen
earlier that day*. Such a post became an instant hotbed of self-righteous climbers appalled by the lack
of respect exhibited earlier that day, with such outrage from the community highlighting the strict
ethics of British mountaineering, with this time ICMC not on the hot end of the climbing ethics debate
(having historically had that one time a student decided to stupidly dry tool a route a millstone, and
narrowly escape Sheffield with his identity still unknown.) The post, alongside the boardgames, Scrawl
and Set provided the evening’s entertainment for the NYE festivities, climaxing with the official
coronation of the incumbent ICMC president.

### Day 5 - Yearly Traditions 01/01/

We awoke, riddled with hangovers and the false promises of a New Year’s Day fry-up. Some
particularly fragile members of the group stayed behind to hold the fort, whilst the rest scouted out
the nearby crag, Creag Dhubh, just outside Newtonmore. The group managed to go three for three
‘weatherproof’ climbing venues, with the crag still wet from previous rainfall and the spray from the
nearby waterfall. At this moment, tired of coming up empty-handed, George and Isaac hatched a
plan to climb the rarely sent route _Oui Oui_ beneath the waterfall and vowed to return later that
week, clad head to toe in Gore-Tex to climb the unconventional route_._ With the forecast predicting
sub zeros temperature for the next day, the evening was spent recovering and preparing to take the
novices out on their first proper winter climbs.

### Day 6 - Blowing away the cobwebs 02/01

With the hangovers of New Year’s quickly becoming a distant memory, the group was ready for a
passing of the torch from the experienced to inexperienced members. Jacob’s Ladder (I) is renowned
for being a particularly stubborn route to disappear, like Raebrun’s Gully (III) and the high gullies (3- 5
(I)) on The Ben, the route can survive all but the most extended and intense heatwaves. The group,
keen to oil their old rusty winter skills, made haste with an early start as it was likely many other
parties were going to rely on ol’ reliable that day. Walking into the bottom of Sneachda there was little
change in the amount of snow compared to two days prior. The group paired up, roped up, and formed the traditional ‘novice send train’ one typically sees on Jacob’s ladder early season when few other climbs have the depth of snow to be in condition.

By the end of the day, everyone had had their taste of Scottish winter climbing at the sharp end, even
if the route in question becomes a motorway for soloists looking for a speedy way to reach the top of
Sneachda. Alex bumped into some old friends from Durham university whilst leading the route –
another repeating theme for the trip. Once at the top, there was little else to do apart from the yearly
pilgrimage to the top of Cairn Gorm Mountain. Standing at 1245m, it is one of the highest peaks in
Scotland, and the weather station at its summit frequently records the highest winds each year, just
standing on the summit that day felt like sticking your head out of a car driving on the motorway!
Thoroughly battered and thrilled for one day, the group descended the north-western slopes of Cairn
Gorm parallel to the ski slopes, which were packed considering the lack of snowfall, and glissaded their
way back down to the Cairngorm café, before being on their way to Aviemore for haggis and chips
with a thorough drowning in gravy!

### Day 7 - Nature’s waterslide 03/01

Another uncharacteristically warm day greeted us, with the low-pressure weather band delaying its
arrival to the next day, other means of entertainment had to be found. With overnight rains drenching
the crags and more precited that morning, many sought refuge in the hut or spent the day making a
considerable dent in their maintenance loans with the assistance of the Aviemore shops. George and
Isaac had other plans; to scale the waterfall at Craig Dubh. They donned marigolds, and Gore-Tex suits,
resembling warriors about to do battle with the waves, and made their way to the crag for their rudimentary rack-cleaning session.
The base of the route was receiving a pounding
from the forceful waterfall above, the last week
of seemingly endless rain and mild temperatures
ensured the waterfall was flowing at full force.
Isaac tentatively dispatched the first pitch,
escaping to the right of the waterfall, and was
shielded from the spray by the above
overhanging rock. George has the pleasure of
leading pitch 2 and was not so lucky. He had to
take a direct line diagonally crossing the
waterfall, first facing the spray, then the full
force of crashing water from the waterfall The
rest of the climbing had a unique atmosphere as
the waterfall climbing was behind you, and now
the route climbed the rock beneath the falling
water, with delicate slab climbing moves and the
deafening sound of water crashing behind you,
it truly was a unique and memorable
experience. Reaching the top, thrilled with their
accomplishments, Gorge and Isaac prepared
and abseil and made it back to the car, escaping
benightment. Regrouping at the hut for a relaxing evening, fresh snow had started to fall outside and
it was not long before
snowball open warfare
erupted inside and out,
with Issy’s fantastic
Welsh being the only
thing that could bring
the cessation of
hostilities.

### Day 8 - Storm Season 04/01

With the potential for our first day of proper winter climbing, Ciaran had green-lit a plan to climb in
Sneachda. Unfortunately, with the week taking its toll on everyone, the day’s pre-dawn start had been
pushed back later and later as everyone fought for an extra ounce of sleep. High winds from the north
bringing heavy snow later in the day meant challenging weather from the get-go, demanding insight,
guile, and strategy from the group to pick the routes in the best condition. One had to consider
aspects, exposure, and the route’s reliance on frozen turf. Immediately most gullies were ruled out
due to the intense wind tunnel effect making upward progress hazardous and frankly miserable, this
led to the group settling for the Mess of Pottage buttress, to left (East) of _Jacob’s Ladder_ (I). Arriving at the Cairngorm base station, we stepped out of the cars with fresh crunchy snow underfoot, with a
feeling of pensiveness hovering amongst the group; with the car park unusually desolate following
early season snowfall, and the challenging conditions underfoot of snow-covered rotten ice, we knew
that the conditions would scare off all but the most determined climbers. The walk-in was a challenge,
the conditions underfoot combined with the high winds meant that skiing your way off the hardly
visible path was a certain, one just hoped to land in the soft heather over a drainage ditch. It quickly
became apparent that today’s conditions were not for all, Piers and Alex heeded caution over the
conditions and turned back to wait in the Ranger Station Café, with Issy soon to join them. They aimed
to join the rest later, hoping that the conditions would lift to provide a weather window for just a pitch
or two of a route.

Unwavered by the wariness of the others, those that persevered split into two groups, with Ciaran,
Olly, and Ben aiming for the route _Hidden Chimney Direct_ (IV, 5 ), and George, Jake, and Isaac
attempting the open mixed terrain to the left of Jacob’s Ladder, encompassing, The Slant (I), Hidden
Chimney (III), and Jacob’s Edge (II). At the base of the route, conditions were just about good enough
with the surface turf being frozen and a thin layer of verglas covering the rock face. Ciaran psyched up
his crew and attempted the first pitch of _Hidden Chimney Direct_ , with a methodical and confident lead
of his first grade IV. Olly successfully followed to the 2nd belay, however, Ben found the conditions
challenging and the climbing alien. Having seen Ciaran successfully dispatch pitch 1, the other team wanted to second the first pitch on the top rope but strengthening winds and poor visibility forced
both teams to bail and escape up _Jacob’s Ladder_ , vowing to come back the following day.

### Day 9 - Go Hard or Go Home 05/01

The last day of the trip presented the best conditions for the past few weeks. With more fresh snow,
the previous evening’s slight thaw, and the already compacted snow from 48 hours ago, the chances
of good conditions were high. With the last pre-dawn start behind them, the group made for the
Cairngorm car park, with Piers expertly saving his car from fishtailing on the drive to Aviemore, much
to the surprise of Olly in the passenger seat. The rewards for our efforts revealed themselves as we
were beaten to the car park and the base of the route only by those who had camped the night before.
Splitting up into the same groups as three days prior, Olly and Issy broke right from the main trail to
Sneachda to attempt the _Ficaill Ridge_ (II), Ciaran and Ben breaking trail to Fluted Buttress to attempt
_Red Wall_ (II), with Jake and George in tow, who themselves were to attempt _The Runnel_ (II), leaving
Piers, Isaac, and Alex to try _Hidden Chimney_ (III). Approach conditions were difficult; with the snow-
loaded western slopes of Fiacaill a’ Choire Chais necessitating a wide birth, groups heading to the
eastern side of the corrie were forced to navigate through the boulder field. Progress was slow and
tedious, with the fresh snow covering the boulders concealing their true shape, the trail-breakers had
to carefully pick their way over and around the boulders, whilst playing a game of minesweeper as
their boots risked breaking the ice below and ruining their day entirely. Piers, Issac, and, Alex were
joined by another team heading to Mess of Pottage and offered to split the boulder-navigating trail-breaking. Through casual chit-chat, the other team was headed to the same route, however, no
queueing was needed, as one of the climbers in their party broke through the ice and flooded both of
their boots, forcing a disappointing retreat to the car park.

All the teams made it to the base of their routes in good time, and with minimal queuing. Olly and Issy
climbed Fiaciall buttress to reach the ridge which had wonderfully varied climbing, allowing the
climber to choose the difficulty of the route. They quickly ascended the first pillar of the ridge climbing
30 ft to the main ridge walk and then the final obstacle, the main ridge itself. The most rewarding line
is a steep, stepped corner with various mantles which Issy sent with ease, leaving only the walk skirting
the corrie rim to reach the other groups further East. One buttress over, Ben and Ciaran were tackling
Red Gully on Fluted Buttress. The route takes an obscure line taking the natural fault right of Fingers
Ridge (IV, 5). The large narrow chimney at the base was banked with deep snow, giving challenging
climbing in the lower section, which continued to climb and increase in difficulty as they progressed.
Ciaran led the first pitch with Ben belaying on his knees to spare his feet from the cold snow. After the
first pitch, the route takes a dogleg right, taking sustained but easier mixed terrain until it opens out
into a funnel-shaped gully near beneath the lip of the plateau above. The pair made constant but slow
progress in the challenging conditions and deep snow, and with the setting sun, head torches and
sparks from Ciaran’s axe hitting the buried granite rocks lit the way to the top. The group was the last
to summit, with both George and Jake on The Runnel, and the Trio on Hidden chimney making light
work of their ascents. The Runnel is the striking central gully that sits highest on Fluted Buttress, the
long snow-plod into the gully rewards the climbers with beautiful, high-angle ice and neve all the way
to the top, leading to a final steep mixed chimney that is the crux of the route.


Jake and George’s efforts were rewarded with good conditions on the lower and middle sections of
the route with good ice. Unfortunately, had unfaithfully left Schtubby back in the hut and was upset
that he had no screws to place on the route. With both lacking experience leading, they took their
time and carefully climbed the route taking in all the pleasures of climbing a crag classic route.

Once all the teams had sent their routes, they rendezvoused at the top of Hidden Chimney on Mess
of Pottage, and much to the surprise of Isaac, were waiting for him at the topped-out the final pitch.
The trio of Isaac, Piers, and Alex had been slowed by their numbers and the need for diligent route
finding. Starting the day at the busy base of Jacob’s Ladder, Isaac started up the first pitch which climbs
the gully of Jacob’s Ladder for 25m then breaks left, climbing through the natural dip in the left gully
wall to gain the vast buttress. The deep snow complicated gear finding and thus finding suitable belay
stances, but after the traverse of the first pitch, Piers took the reigns to continue diagonally up the
buttress blinding following a natural diagonal break until the route’s final crux pitch reveals itself.
Upon reaching the third belay, Piers belayed Isaac then Alex, with (surprise surprise) Jonty - Alex’s
friend – in tow, who complained about a slow-moving but thoroughly psyched party (Jake and George)
that had hampered their earlier progress on The Runnel. After a brief catchup, and with dying light
and temperatures dropping, Isaac led the stunning final pitch, containing the bridging-move-filled
chimney, all the way to the plateau and the awaiting groups above. Piers and Alex followed on, chasing
the sound of the faint cheers and heckles of those above as they reveled in the successes of the day.
Once regrouped at the top of the plateau, the group made their way to the Chais ridge under the light
of a bright moonrise, and back to the car park to get ready for the long trip back to London the next
morning.

## Tour Review

With technical mixed climbing completed by everyone in the group, one could argue that it was a
success, given the relatively slim chances of having good conditions during a trip so early in the winter
season. Typically, during late December and early January, climbing is possible, but the quality can
vary due to the temperature being too high for sustained freeze-thaw cycles, which leads to the build-
up of ice and deep snow, both on the buttresses and faces. Without these cycles, when new snow
falls, it lingers in its powdery state before melting completely, which doesn’t provide the best
conditions and easily makes climbing 1-2 grades harder due to the lack of extra pick and crampon
placements which are provided by the bonding ice, thus also making other placements feel insecure
and requiring greater balance and technique.

The novices amongst the group received in-depth instruction and guidance into Scottish winter
climbing, which should provide a valuable base for future winter tours and experience that can be
used for future expeditions to The Alps and Alaska, however, limited opportunities to further develop
these skills on lead will stunt progress. More advanced members of the group completed their
objective – to have fun – with many agreeing that it was one of their better winter trips in recent
memory.


## Closing Remarks and Future Plans

Overall, the success of the tour is best highlighted by the group’s desire to return to the northern
corries in the future, with all members either intending to return for the tour next year or return later
in the season for more winter climbing in better conditions! ICMC wholeheartedly wishes to return to
the northern Cairngorms for another winter tour in 2022/23 and train the next generation of Imperial
students in the niche skills used in Scottish winter mountaineering.
