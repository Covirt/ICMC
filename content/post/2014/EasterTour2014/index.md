Sunday 30th March to Thursday the 10th April

## 30th March

Rushes are made through the airport as some people accidentally got on guided tours of south
London instead of the easy bus to Stansted. Everyone makes it on the plane after some luggage is
moved around to make the weights fit. Once in Antalya we meet the driver set to take us to our
campsite. We arrive too late for dinner and in conditions too dark to see how close the cliffs are.
People eat and find their way to their tent rooms.

## 31 st March

Teaching day. We head to an easy, short section of the cliffs, trekking through the undergrowth for
approximately 30 seconds having left the campsite. People realise that climbing outside is more
difficult when you can’t see where all the holds are. In the afternoon people travel into the nearest
village to buy supply’s.

## 1st April


Happy that most of the fresher’s can lead we head to the other
end of the cliff where there climbing is more varied. Here we
watch over the novices to make sure everything goes to plan
but also have an opportunity to push for some harder grades
with Neo climbing a 6b. We retire to the campsite to cook
dinner and drink beers and soft drinks.

## 2nd April


We head for the main sector. The larger cliff boasts some of the
more impressive routes of the area, including Barbarossa, a
secret climb found only by those who know where it is. Almost
everyone climbs this bizarre route which ends with a section of
caving out onto the face of the cliff.
People greatly enjoy this.


## 3rd April

Rest for some as a group take some of the local street dogs on a walk up
to some ancient ruins. En route they find a tortoise. His name Is Pete.
Pete the tortoise. They put him back and continue walking the dogs until
they can hardly hear the screams of people falling off their projects,
safely. Others refuse to rest and continue climbing until they run out of
finger skin.

## 4th April

Project day. Everyone is happy that they can climb in groups by
themselves and as a result people break away and head to climb
whatever they want, all within minutes’ walk of the campsite. These people try harder routes that they can’t climb at first, some of them even fall off without shouting
‘take’. This is good. Jamie finds a 7b, Will looks for a 7a and others continue climbing in new sectors,
gaining experience all the while. More people head into town to buy more supplies. Laura’s ability to
speak Turkish has now become a vital part of tour logistics.

## 5th April

More projects, people spend the morning heading to projects or
going off to explore the small amount of multi pitching available in
the area. Ben finds a 7b+ project, defiantly not chosen as it was
behind his tent and within applauding range of the campsite. So
modest. In the afternoon a sectret crag is found where the floor
seems to be entirely made of sheep poo. This turns out to be
correct. Unfortunately this can’t make up for the difficult nature of
the climbing there so people head back out through the trap door
to the crag and back down the road.

## 6th April

Everyone decides to head into the village to experience the local
market and grab some grub authentic grub for lunch. We have a
race into town which is won by Jamie and Ben. They celebrate by
drinking beer and soft drinks. Will arrives in a lorry and the others
soon appear. Most of the group manage to avoid buying fake beats headphones and make it to the
food end of the market. What a delight, Turkish delight that is. Gifts are bought for loved and liked
ones out of a sense of duty and people head to a little hut to eat Gözlemes. They are tasty, savoury,
pancake-like naan bread things with stuff in them, and they are cheap. Full of fillings people make
their way back to the campsite and some even do some climbing. Ben sends his project, no one
cares.

## 7th April

Fun day to Olympos. Two cars are rented and driven to the coast. Here we enjoy a local brunch before sauntering to the beach. Some head out to look for climbs and find wondrous 7a’s that they send and then return to meet the
others. Walking down the beach, everyone
stops off for a tasty sea side dinner of fish and
meats and beers and soft drinks. As the sun
goes down everyone has a cheeky boulder by
the sea and some choose to brave the
refreshing sea waters with their pants on.
Eventually everyone returns to the cars and
heads back to the campsite.

## 8th April

Tired, some people work their projects but most cherry pick easier climbs in relaxed fashion.
Federico unfortunately takes a bit of a tumble, catching his foot as he is caught by the rope. He is
first aided back to camp and splinted. People are sad for Federico, but Federico is still happy, as
always. That night people reminisce about the trip they are on as they realise that there are only a
few days left to send.


## 9th April

Sending day and everyone’s on form. Jamie narrowly
misses sending his 7b, Ben waddles his way up a 7c
and everyone seems happy with the marked
improvement in their climbing both physically and
from a technical proficiency angle. AS Federico is still
in pain he is taken to ER and patched up properly, he
returns gloriously with a crutch and a smile.
Everyone celebrates with food and beer and soft
drinks with the street dogs and cats they have
befriended.


## 10th April

People pack their bags and ferry onto the bus back to
the airport. Using Laura, we find our flight and
Federico is wheeled away. Once everyone has explained to the security that Ben is not a terror suspect, he is allowed to take his quick draws onto
the plane and everyone settles down. In London
people say their goodbyes but only till term starts again.

### Note to Reader

It may seem that not a lot happened on this holiday but due to the vicinity and ease with which it
was possible to climb nearly un ending number of routes, people spent most of the holiday revelling
in the ecstasy that is summer sport climbing. Too much was climbed to possibly note down.
