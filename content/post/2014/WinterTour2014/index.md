# ICMC Winter Tour Report

# Cairngorms 4th - 10 th Jan 2015

As has been the case for the last few years the club returned to the Cairngorms. Our usual
accommodation just behind the train station in Aviemore was not available as the trip ran later in the year
than usual. Instead we stayed in Nethy Bridge, about 20 minutes further away. The trip saw mild conditions
turning colder as the week went on. Any routes that were completed were generally quite lean and icy!

## Diary

### Day 1

Bought food on the way up in Glasgow, completed shop in a record time of 1 ¼ hrs! For the final leg
of the journey Jo took ascended as DJ managing to carefully choose the best dramatic music resulting in the
perfect ambiance as we approached our destination at 9pm.

### Day 2

Very lean conditions, James, Will and Tom attempted Red Gully (II) but backed off because the ice
that forms the back of the route turned into a stream! Headed over to Fiacaill Coulouir (III) which was a bit
bare at the top but a brilliant route non-the less, they then dropped off back to the carpark down Fiacaill
Ridge which was bare and in summer condition.

Nicolau honed his self arresting skills, Charlie lost his white helmet in the snow and Cat started her
winter skills course with Cairngorm Adventure Guides.

Knut cooked us all an interesting German noodle dish, which was very very very filling. Went well
with beer.


### Day 3

Snow, snow everywhere, but not much to climb. Cat completed her first winter route with Sam her
guide, Central Gully (I). Everybody else went up and round the back of Lochan topping out through The
Couloir (I/II), we then headed over to Ben Macdui and then finally down the goat track. A brilliant day ended
with some yummy carbonara which was mainly cream.

### Day 4

A warmer day meant we headed back to Cummingstone on the Moray Coast, about an hours drive
north. After a good experience last year we were not disappointed again, climbing the relatively short and
welcoming crags on the coastline is welcome relief from being blasted by spindrift on the tops of the
Cairngorm Plateau. A local, who we had met the previous day heading back to the car park, congratulated us
on our decision to head to ‘Marvoulous Moray’ it seems to be the place to go when the weather turns a bit
naff in the mountains. We had roast pork for dinner and filled the house with roast potatoes.

### Day 5

Great conditions! We split the groups up a little as Cat had just finished her course and Georgia was joining us from Liverpool MC. Jo, James and Nicolau completed Red Gully (II) and found the torque nut that Will had left earlier in the week. Jon, Knut and Chris climbed the seam (IV), Tom Charlie and Sally climbed Central Gully and Will Georgia and Cat climbed the Runnel which was very icy at the top! All parties topped out a similar time and were back in the carpark by nightfall.

Chickpea and butternut squash curry for dinner.

### Day 6

Everybody was a bit knackerd and the snow was melting, but a group of us headed over to
Cairngorm Mountain and went sledging using survival bags. We also saw some reindeer! Secret santa
ensued with £0 budget. The prolific Icy MC clothing range was expanded to new heights again this year! We
cooked about 10 litres of fish pie for dinner.

### Day 7

Poor conditions, extremely high winds (+130mph), and a warm outlook mean that we cut the trip
short and headed home.


## Financial Breakdown

Tiny profit due to some rounding errors in ticket income calculation. The low cost per head of just over £ 90
was due mainly to the accommodation being half the price it was last year and spending nearly more than
£100 less on food (less cheese, alcohol and meat was purchased). The slightly higher tour allocation was also
useful!
