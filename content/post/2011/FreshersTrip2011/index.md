## 14/10/2011
Work begins to get the first ever ICMC three minibus trip going in the morning with
Joel, Kip, Murray and others completing an epic food shop. By around 4pm minibuses are in position
outside Beit apart from bus 3 which turns out to be lacking a roof rack. Cue a quick cycling mission
for Ali & Dan to go get a new bus from Charing Cross. Well, the cycling part was quick anyway. On
the upside, by the time they make it back, the other buses are loaded and soon 3 buses and a car are
heading north before 7pm, go efficiency!

After the usual arguments about routes out of London and phonecalls en-route to try and determine
who’s “winning”, all the buses make it to the hall by 11:30, Ed Stott’s car scoring an unsurprising
victory owing to lack of speed limiter. Lisa is picked up from Cromford train station by Ed. Turns out
that the key for the hall is not where it’s supposed to be, thankfully access is temporarily gained by
other means. The key eventually arrives, beer is drunk, sleeping arrangements are sorted and
everyone beds down ready for an early start. There is a minor diplomatic incident when older
members discover that the club’s new overlords have removed bacon & sausage from breakfast in
the name of austerity. Forget bank bailouts, this is the front line of the recession right here.

Porridge time comes all too soon. It’s lacking in bacon. Egg is abandoned in the name of
efficiency. On the upside, the buses leave in record time owing to lack of the faff of doing a fry-up for 50. Fresher nearly causes a bus-on-bus accident with an outrageous roundabout wrong-lane
overtaking manoeuvre. Ali scores a moral victory by not taking the trap turning for Froggatt and
getting there first. After a bit of a wait for the third bus, everyone reunites at the crag carpark, including Andy and Lizzie who join us at the crag.

Those wanting to climb routes were quickly split into groups of
3 with one novice climber per. group whilst the boulderers set
off to explore. On the bouldering front, Ape Drape (6c+) and
Jet Pack (7b / Tom Coyne 6c+) saw many ascents and quite a
few new climbers discovered the joys of Tody’s playground.

On the trad front Tody’s wall (HVS 5a) sees lots of action with
Lizzie, Ben, Joe and Murray all leading it. Great effort from
Lizzie & Joe in particular as it’s a tricky one for shorter
climbers! It was also Joe’s first HVS! Ali remembered how to
place gear again eventually on a shaky ascent of the brilliant
Brightside (E2 5c). Ben and Tom went on to make short work
of Valkyrie (HVS 5a), Three Pebble Slab (E1 5a) & The Big Crack
(E2 5b), surely the hardest trad climbed by Freshers on a
Freshers’ trip!

Meanwhile, the new climbers were getting a feel for climbing
on grit and gear placement by seconding older members. After
some teaching in how to place gear, lots of first leads were
done with Gamma (VDiff), Slab Recess (Diff), Trapeze (VDiff) and many others all seeing plenty of
attention. I didn’t get to see everyone who did their first leads but well played to Jack and Joel who I did see lead for the first time. Great to see so many people taking their first steps into the world of
trad climbing and loving every minute.

Meanwhile, most of the boulderers headed along to Curbar to sample the classic delights of the
Trackside boulder & the Guerrilla Warfare block. Not sure what got done but everyone was pretty
tired by this point. Finally, Tom & Ali managed to scrape a couple of pads together for a ground-up
solo of Oedipus Ring Your Mother (E4 6a). After a few test-jumps from higher and higher followed by
a prompt schooling by a local, both were successful. Respect goes to Tom for dynoing the
penultimate move with feet probably 6 meters from the deck. Ali lanked it but then got his
comeuppance taking a pretty massive fall onto the pads whilst down-climbing back down the route!
As the sun went down, there was a bit more action on Three Pebble Slab (E1 5a). Johan had a
successful lead after a little trepidation, sadly Ruth (kicked her gear out) and Lisa (soloing!) were not
so successful and ended up being thrown top-ropes.

Back at the hut the evening’s fun and games began (Fresher making an essential beer refuelling run
on the way home). Ruth overcame intoxication in order to rig up the sock game which proved to be
a big hit as usual. As usual, there were no real winners thanks to the winner stays on format but
suffice to say almost everyone tasted the sweet bag wine of failure at some point that night. Murray
then decided to try out bouldering mat sumo which turned out to be entertaining hazardous.

Murray promptly proves this statement by injuring his finger during the game. Chilli eventually
arrives (no small task for 50) and is enjoyed by all. Sam turns up at around midnight from York!

## 16/10/2011

Day breaks and it’s time for Stanage, the biggest crag in the Peak District. There’s egg
and porridge for breakfast this time but thankfully not at the same time. Everyone packs up and
cleans the hall surprisingly quickly and we’re underway in no time. On the drive, fog around the edge
causes alarm but thankfully upon arrival, the crag is
dry. Lots of people bouldering this time, everyone
enjoying the quality across all the grades that Stanage
Plantation offers. Green traverse (7a) sees lots of
attention as usual. It also sees a lot of frustrating falls
right from the end as ever! A big group gets stuck into
the terrifying delights of Crescent Arete (5+ but
HIGH!) with Tom, Ali, Lisa and Dave all topping out
with only minor psychological scarring!

Continuing the highball theme the tall Not To Be
Taken Away (6c) is up next with Tom, Cheehan & Ali
all topping it out. Cheehan goes on to have a very
good day indeed ticking Brad Pitt (7c), Captain Hook
(7b) and Zippy’s Traverse (7a+). In fact most boulders
in the plantation have an in-situ ICMC group on them
with everyone seeming to have a good time.

Amongst those trad climbing, Joe manages to have a
particularly good day with ascents of the classic Goliath’s Groove (HVS 5a) and Millsom’s Minion (E1 5b – Joe’s first E1). After the success of his first
lead at Froggatt, Jack has less luck on a VDiff at Stanage when he discovers that the finish of the
route is through a hole smaller than he is! Johan does a good looking E1 (can’t remember the name,
sorry) and Fresher gets stuck in some horrible wide cracks like usual.

After the traditional benightment (finishing climbing in the dark) courtesy of Luca & Tristan it’s time
to begin the long journey home. Even longer for Sam who is dropped off to get a train back to North
Wales – mental! After a couple of hours (and one navigator who seems REALLY keen to go to Derby
rather than the M1) the busses arrive in Loughbrough for the traditional pizza stop. Many Meat
Junctions are consumed and drivers are topped up on caffeine. Sometime around 1am the buses
return to Beit Quad, gear goes back in stores and everyone heads home, tired but hopefully as happy
as I was!

Thanks to everyone who came on the trip for making it one of the best we’ve had. Thanks to the
photographers (Pedro, Ed, Jeffrey & Murray) for all the great pictures. Finally, big thanks to all of the
committee who selflessly give up a lot of their time to make trips like this possible.

I hope to see all of you soon on another of our trips!
