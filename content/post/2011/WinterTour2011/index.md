## Objectives

The main objective was to have fun and everyone agreed that we'd met this goal.

An important secondary objective of the tour was to introduce younger members of the
club to winter climbing with the hope that the skills they acquired would stay in the club
for years to come. As no-one sold their boots afterwards I would consider this achieved!
The main difficulties of winter climbing for the club are the long drive, variable conditions
and the high cost of entry. It is hoped that with the recent purchase of boots (joint with
outdoor club) will remove one of the most expensive purchases that aspiring mountaineers
have to make (boots are ~£300) and will increase participation in this sport.

## Tour Diary

### Day one

Getting an early start for the 14 hour bus journey to Scotland we packed up the
bus in record time and set off at 10am. Our excitement reached unprecedented levels
when the first flakes of snow were spotted on the M6. Unfortunately this caused a traffic
jam, but we managed to avoid it with a scenic tour of Staffordshire.
The trip almost ended for two of the tour's members when they decided to save
some money by buying some bread and chicken from a M&S at a service station. All was
going well, until a comment from Ben about how the chicken was a little squishy lead to
the discovery of cooking instructions, Tom had already wolfed the whole packet...
Fortunately all was well, and much fun was had in Glasgow’s Tescos buying food before
arriving at our palace for the week.

### Day two


First day of climbing for the more experienced members and the first day of winter
skills course for the novices. The guide Kevin came to the palace to talk us through what
we would be doing, he changed his plan from a two day winter skills course to a one day
winter skills course and a day climbing an easy route.
The first day we got used to walking around in the snow, wearing crampons, using
iceaxes, self belays and self arrests. The day was tiring but great fun. Kevin took the
novices back to the palace and we got started on food. Roast pork with potatoes and veg.
Parsons and friends arrived late in the evening.

### Day Three

Again the older members went to do some climbing of their own before having to
supervise the novices. Kevin and the novices set off up a grade I climb, with Tom, Ben,
Hamzah and Ruth getting their first winter climb! This was very valuable as Kevin was able
to solo around the leaders (something that we would not be able to do as a club) showing
them how to find gear placements in the snow and demonstrating winter specific belay
techniques.
The novices got down early again and got on with food, Roast lamb shoulder (reduced from
Tesco) with rice, mash and veg. Parsons’ crew were impressed with our culinary
skills...perhaps we could increase them with a cooking course?

### Day Four

Joe took Tom and Ben up the Slant (grade II) splitting it into three pitches to give the two
novices a good chance of leading. Joe’s team topped out first due to alpine efficiency and
got off the mountain in good time. James took Hamzah up the same route as Joe’s team
with James leading the whole route in the recommended two pitches. Jonathan took Ruth
up a slightly harder route with Jonathan leading both pitches, first route climbed with
overhanging steps! (variation of Hidden Chimney) At the top the two separate parties
bumped into each other and agreed to navigate off together. Conditions were sub-optimal
with strong winds(gusting up to 50mph), minimal visibility and heavy snow. However, good
navigational skills from Jonathan in challenging conditions got us safely off and back to the
bus where Joe’s party were ready and waiting for us. Dinner was cooked by Parsons’
group chilli and there was gateaux.

### Day Five


Joe, Tom and Ben wanted to try the route Jonathan and Ruth did the day before so set off
early for a day on the hill whilst everyone else took a well earned rest day. Bourbons with
whipped cream were eaten in abundance in the command palace. Dinner was cheesy-eggy-
pasta with sausages and veg.

### Day Six
“Raining at all altitudes” – were not the words we wanted to hear and looking out the
window the previously picturesque white landscape had transformed to a patchy white,
green and mostly brown view. For the group who had a rest day on day five this was very
disappointing, but unavoidable. So we took a trip to Avimore, but didn’t have time for a
trip to a distillery. The evening was spent playing hide and seek, with more obscure and
precarious places found as the night progressed. Dinner was curry.

### Day seven
The long drive home, with a slightly detoured route to drop Joe, James, Ruth and Ben at
various locations on route. We were also able to pick up some winter boots jointly bought

by ICMC and Outdoor Club.
