Addressed to: The Chief Custodian, Stonehenge, Wiltshire

Dear Sir,
I am writing to apologise on behalf of the Imperial College Mountaineering Club for the inconveniance certain members cause on Monday Morning the 8th of December. We respectfully request that you return our confiscated rope which we need for our expedition to Scotland this Christmas. I enclose a 51-postal order to cover the postage. Again offering my sincere apologies,

Yours Faithfully
