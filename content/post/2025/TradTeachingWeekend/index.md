<!-- Trip report text here: -->
The postgrads (and a few undergrads) took a trip to the Peak District with the goal of teaching trad to as many keen members as possible. A few boulderers also came along to fill the bus seats.


Highlights of the trip include:
- Amar mysteriously waking up (sleep walking?) in the middle of a circle of chairs in the village hall.
- Jeremy cooking an amazing beef stew (ICMC has gone boujee), and also finding himself in the middle of a circle of tables.
- Amazing, sunny weather all weekend
- Tom Richards wildly following advice on routes to climb with complete disregard for himself.
- 8 new trad leaders in the postgrads!
- Learning to crack climb
- Learning to properly tension a rope anchor before sitting on the edge of a cliff (see photos).
- Tom Richards receiving a delivery of additional gear mid-route on his first E1.

Notable sends:
- Lone Boulder Overhang (V2?). Steep side sit start.
- Bollard crack (VS 4C allegedly but so so burly, shout out to my boy Big Green for protecting the top section)
- Todycade E1
- Turnbullâ€™s Trajectory, HS
- Paradise Wall HS 4b
- Even though I sent my first E1 (Nanoq Slab), highlight was the absolute battle up Silver Crack HS (hard to decide) 
- Cleft wall route 1

Shoutouts:
- Jeremy! His cooking definitely helped my cold! Noah! Such great company. Everyone organising! Out and climbing at 10am is a real feat!

- Shout out to Amy, Miguel, and All the other teachers! Really doing god's work teaching beginners trad on possibly the nicest climbing weather weekend the peaks have ever seen
