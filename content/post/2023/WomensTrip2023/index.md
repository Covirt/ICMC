## Trip Report ##

The absolutely epic ICMC Women & Gender Inclusive trip went ahead to the Isle of Portland in November!

No matter the level of experience, all were welcome, so as you can imagine the vibes were impeccable with some people excited to outdoor climb for the first time and others returning to crush their projects.

A special thanks to Rockfax for giving us access to their guidebook for the start of the year and Tenzing for the high energy!

## Highlights ##

Asha’s Two Stars: 

1. Being rescued by Amy and Sofia’s 10/10  trad anchor at the top of Neddyfield’s in the dark after my locking carabiner wouldn’t unlock! 
2. The sunset at the New Cuttings boulderfield with the bouldering gang, getting addicted to The Slide 7B, then trying to find our way back in the dark!

Maz’s Two Stars:

1. The sound of waves crashing behind us whilst we were climbing
2. The overnight oats and chugging oatmilk before the drive back

Yujiao’s Two Stars:

1. Watching the view of the sea while resting on the wall
2. Completing the 500 pieces puzzle with Justine when everyone else went sleeping

Lauren’s Two Stars:

1. Getting to experience how beautiful Portland is - Getting to the top of the route and turning around to take in the sea view was incredible.
2. My first outdoor lead!
