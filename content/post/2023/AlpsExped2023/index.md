Here is an extract describing our time climbing the Lion Ridge on the Matterhorn:

> Isaac called an early morning (midday) meeting at the operations room (bakery) to discuss plans for the coming days. He promised a ‘very well thought out plan’ and warned to ‘prepare for unprecedented levels of sensibleness’. The bakery was fantastic, though, so everyone was happy to oblige.

And another extract, from later in the section:

> A big, steep, exposed traverse on hard snow, sometimes ice, rock thankfully within reach for protection, followed. Sporadic fixed gear and steep mixed terrain returned to the ridge of Pic Tyndall. Rock gave way to snow and ice here, as teams negotiated the fantastic undulating ridge and snow slopes of this lesser summit. This section was by far the highest quality: free of fixed gear, technical and exposed, but never difficult. Until this point the view of the Matterhorn had been obscured by a combination of cloud and Pic Tyndall, but now caught incredible glimpses of it through breaks in the light cloud cover. Words would not do it justice. Pictures come closer.
