### Member Attendees:

Richard Metcalfe, Stuart McClune, Alex Smith, Charlotte Krishek, Kuran Pahwa, Hannah Nevill, Shan Pandya, Keeran Sivalingam, Nick Koukoulekidis, Mertcan Sevgi, Sean Barret, Suviti Chari.

## Aims and objectives

To pull hard on the amazing rock climbs in the valleys
surrounding Chulilla; a very popular, new climbing
area in southern Spain. Many of the members had
never climbed outdoors before so another aim was to
teach them how to safely operate ropes and deal with
the situations that arise from climbing outdoors.

## Day 1

After a crazily early start (or all-nighter in the case of
the members returning from the peak district trip) to
catch the 7:30 flight to Valencia, the group managed
to pull together enough psych to go and climb on the
roadside crags in Chulilla. This gave the perfect taste
of the week ahead, lovely limestone climbs, well
bolted routes, and lots of laughter. A trip to the shops
for cheap Spanish wine was undertaken. Food was
also found, and the group enjoyed a warm evening
inside before heading to bed early.

## Day 2

After a breakfast of porridge (described as the
most meagre portion of porridge ever by one
member) the group headed to the crag. A nice
morning in the shade was had, teaching people
all of the key safety aspects of route cleaning
and other such fun. Alex and Richard went off
to climb a simple multipitch in the afternoon
whilst the rest of the group climbed some
more on the shorter walls before enjoying the
cooling river and a slackline session. Alex and
Richard were having way more fun as they had
decided abseiling was lame, and they would
walk off the top of their route. 3 hours later
and an abseil through a bramble bush they get
back onto the path, dehydrated and
knackered. An enjoyable meal and bonding
session was had in the evening.

## Day 3

REST DayYYYY. The group headed to a different sector and
had a nice morning of easy climbing to cure their
hangovers. Lunch was had at an incredible swimming area
with beautiful limestone caves hiding behind the
waterfalls. The group then decided clothes were lame and
posed for a centre fold picture. Some preceded to stay
naked for a lot longer than was necessary. Supplies were
gathered for another night and the group had an
incredible BBQ before building a fire and spending the
evening outside.

## Day 4


A day jam packed with crushing, single and multi-pitch
climbing along with some idiocy from the future president.
Everyone was feeling refreshed and full of psych. Two groups headed off to try some multi pitch
early in the morning. Richard and Hannah flew up their route whilst Charlotte and Shan dawdled up
theirs. Everyone else climbed at a new crag, got very hot and then left in search of food. The group
reassembled for lunch and then Alex, Stuart and Richard headed off to try something hard in the
Sex-Shop sector. The aptly named Eco-Dildo was the route of choice and the three guys stayed late
trying for the send. Richard was a moron and didn’t take any quickdraws with him so downclimbed
the crux on his flash attempt before coming down screaming. Stuart then crushed and flashed a
grade he’d never climbed before (what a wad). Alex was weak. Everyone reconvened at the house
for a delicious Bolognese.

## Day 5

It was the last day of climbing for the group; people were sad and exhausted. This didn’t stop them
though. Stuart crushed again; flashing another 7a. Everyone pulled hard on routes and could be
proud of what they achieved across the week. An early dinner of stir fry was had before another fire
and more wine was enjoyed. Some youths were staying next door and at 4am Mert went full dad
mode and told them to shut off the music. He also made the group sandwiches, which were
incredible and well needed at the airport the following morning.

## Day 6

Glassy eyed and a bit broken the group arose at 6am to travel home. At the airport the group
wallowed in self-pity but no regrets at Burger King before boarding the flight back to London.
