## Journey to the Peak District

This year’s fresher’s trip was another record breaker for number of members attending, 3 full
minibuses and a car were required with many former members meeting us in the Peak District.
Preparations for the trip were impressive with Joel organising a visit to Costco to buy vast quantities
of cheap food before the trip which saved considerable amounts of money, so much so that we saw
the return of bacon to ICMC. Loading of the 3 buses began at about 4 which allowed for departure
before 6 for one of the buses and the other 2 were on the road before 7. The car driver was last to
arrive and picked up the remaining people. The usual argument of the best way out of London
ensued with everyone apparently taking different routes to eventually get to the M1.

Heading north on the M1 was exceedingly boring this year with no major incidents resulting in an
early arrival at the village hall. The bus driven by Murray and Caroline (and not Fails) had been given
2 different sets of directions on how to get to the hall, one by Joel which directed them to Derby and
one set by Kip which directed them to the village hall. The directions from Kip were chosen so as it
was suspected that Joel just wanted everyone to go to Derby again. Arriving at the village hall, it was
discovered that the minibus which left first had arrived first and gone to the pub after shotgunning
all the matts to sleep on, the car had also arrived ages before due to not being limited to 100kph.

After letting the freshers stretch their legs a bit and play with some of the toys left in the village hall
by other users they were put to bed by Joel who then retired to a private room with Stefan. Several
freshers were fighting over who gets to sleep on the bouldering pads. This was allowed to continue
until a winner was decided at which point an older member went over and informed them that
sleeping on the pads was banned as it damages them. Freshers were sad until they were given a roll
mat, all of which had been taken out the bus this year.

## Day 1 – Froggatt Edge

Joel and Stefan were first up in the morning
and spent an hour cooking bacon and eggs for
people before waking everyone else up. Joel
was enjoying the opportunity to model his
ICMC braded clothing in the kitchen which
looked fabulous. Once breakfast was ready
everyone got out of their sleeping bags very
quickly only to discover an unreasonable
bread ration was being enforced of only 4
Green eggs and ham 
slices per day. Unfortunately Joel’s clothing
clashed with the peculiarly coloured eggs, it
seemed that Joel had bought the eggs rather a
while ago and they were not the expected
colour. The green eggs and ham were still eaten
by many to make up for the shortages of other
food. Loading the bus was another faff with
people getting confused about which bus they
were getting on. The first bus to leave left with
an empty seat as they didn’t wait for everyone
but karma caught up with them as they took the
trap signpost to the village instead of the crag
and lost their time advantage. Fortunately the
car had a spare seat so nobody was left behind.

Leaving first with all the equipment meant the
first bus also had lots of fun caring everything to
the crag while those who were last to arrive
didn’t have to carry must at all. Amusing antics
by the other 2 minibuses mean’t the first bus
was also completely blocked in.

Taking 50 people to a crag, even one as large as
Frogatt would be a silly idea and would probably
upset the locals, so half the trip carried on along
the path to Curbar and Trackside. This venture
was all bouldering and many boulders were
climbed on. The people remaining at Froggatt all
went trad climbing in groups of 3 which had
been pre-allocated by Joel, another
improvement on last years trip. However due
this did cause some upset members who wanted
to climb with their friends and those who
wanted good belayers for harder climbs later in
the day.

Initially many easy climbs were done to let the
new climbers get up a few things. No top ropes
were set up by ICMC at all meaning that there
was no route hogging which so many people get
upset by. Additionally we avoided some of the 3
star classics as there tends to be a big queue for
them and we didn’t want to add to this. There
were 4 other university groups there as well
which caused some confusion due to mistaken
identity. One of the groups was from

Loughbourgh and had previously been
encountered in Fontainebleau, the
notorious “Rapey Dave” was
rumoured to be at the crag but was
not found.

Joel enjoyed the ultra-classic Toddy’s
Wall (HVS) which it’s ridiculous cock
over and overall outstanding quality. 2
ascents of three Pebble Slab (HVS)
were attempted by Ben and Murray
with Ben asking for a rope to be
rescued and Murray manning up and
finishing it. Tom climbed another
mega classic called Chequers Buttress
after camping at the bottom for 5
other people to go up it. Kip climbed
his first E1 Strapiombante which was
incredibly pumpy and no other clean
ascents were made, even by his
second. Murray did try it but fell
off/pusseyed out on the last move.
Kips victory is in addition to using his
band new aliens which did not
explode when used which is an
impressive feet in its own right.

Not everyone had such a productive
day out. Andy fell off one of his climbs
during the crux and managed to rip
out 2 pieces of gear, one came out
because the rock exploded.
Fortunately he had been placing many
pieces of good gear before this point
so only had a small fall. Other people
at the crag who are in no way
affiliated with ICMC faired much
worse. One person managed to kick
out his gear on an E2 and then almost
hit the deck. While a different person
fell off of the extremely run out
Browns Eliminate which has gear just
below half height, he inverted and hit the floor. The guy’s helmet took the impact and was
destroyed, but this took all of the force and he was fine. A number of other groups set up top ropes
of classic climbs and then dogged up them polishing the holds a little more.


It was decided that once the sun started to set it was probably time to leave the crag. After packing
up and picking up everybody else’s litter people headed back to the bus. Older members had head
torches as they knew that we never leave the crag until it’s too dark to see and they helped
everybody else back to the bus. Returning to the village hall dinner was started, learning from last
year it was cooked in several small batches. A few beers were had by most people and silly antics
ensued. Joel and Murray decided to play a game involving a rope, they both ended up half naked
with Joel using his thighs to squeeze Murray’s head so his sock could be removed. Eventually people
headed to bed.

## Day 2 – Stannage Edge

Again Joel and Stefan got up early to
cook breakfast for everyone. More
issues ensued with the eggs as it
became apparent that some of the
eggs were a bit more red than might
be expected, after being reminded
that eggs are essentially chicken
periods everyone decided to eat them
anyway. Packing up everyone’s stuff
and leaving the hall was also a speedy
affair meaning that we got to the crag
very early. People ran off to do different things all along Stannage. As a regular club place to visit
many people had projects and climbs on their tick lists that they wanted to get done. There was a lot
more easy bouldering than the previous day so many of the freshers had a go at that.

Ali and Murray spent a while trying to do Deliverance, Ali had spent many a day falling off the
impressive dyno and spent much of this day doing the same. Lizzie climbed both the left and right
unconquerables (E1 and HVS respectively), Murray wanted to climb these as well but pulled a
tendon in his elbow so decided not to. Ben crushed some E2 climbs and many other routes were
done by people. The day was a bit warm for particularly hard climbs as the friction gets worse with
heat.

Martin had a minor accident while bouldering, he jumped off a climb but there was a small rock
under the bouldering pad which resulted in a twisted ankle. First aid was given and this opportunity
was taken to crack out the ICMC SAM splints which made the injury look much more severe than it
was. Murray gave his professional diagnosis of “defiantly not broken” which will hopefully break his
100% rate of incorrect diagnosis. Martin was helped home by Amy and the two of them were given
places in the car so that they could get back to London earlier and be dropped home to avoid any
need to walk.

Joel started getting everyone to pack up and head to the bus at 4 o’clock. This was considered very
early by a number of older members, particularly 3 ex-presidents and Fresher who decided to stage
a mutiny. Unfortunately 3 out of the 4 people on the mutiny were not taking the buses back to
London so noting really happened as a result of this. There was some considerable debate amongst
members as to which bus they wanted to go home in and with which drivers. Eventually the
unpopular driver was put in the unpopular bus and filled with people who were unaware of the
reasons for them being unpopular; fortunately no incidents occurred on the way home.

On the journey home each bus stopped at the Pizza place in Loughborough arriving just as the
previous bus was finishing so the pizza place was not totally overwhelmed. During the journey home
BBC Radio 1’s Sunday Surgery was put on to entertain the drivers with other people’s misfortune.
The surgery was rather boring with people mostly complaining about their weight. The final person
to call up was called Mr Baggins-Mendes had a slightly more interesting story about a gay friend who
kept hitting on him. Mr Baggins-Mendes kept refusing the other gentleman’s advances on the
pretence that he was straight however he secretly has feelings for the gentleman but is unsure
about coming out. The Surgery suggested that Me Baggins-Mendes bite the bullet and go for it
however he remained unconvinced.

The buses arrived back at the union outrageously early and managed to unpack and get everything
away in time for people to catch the tube home, a rare occasion for an ICMC trip. Overall everyone
seemed to enjoy the trip with many people climbing outside for their first time and several others
doing their best climbing ever. No freshers were recorded missing which is yet another impressive
achievement for the new president.
