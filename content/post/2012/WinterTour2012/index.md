The trip started with a promisingly early beginning with the bus leaving at 8am. After an unusually uneventful drive we arrived early at the accommodation and as such were unequipped to deal with 
dinner. An early search party set off in search of takeaway, unfortunately the chip shop was closed, 
but further trekking revealed a Tesco’s selling microwave pizzas. There was much rejoicing. 

The next day began with Aviemore’s finest in winter safety instruction, the mighty Kevin, arriving to talk the novices through their first day in the mountains. Meanwhile, the passion wagon, plus Hamzah, 
had already packed camp and headed for the snow. The main party followed in hot pursuit, eventually 
meeting them in the bottom of the coire. Kevin promptly got the novices running about in the snow 
learning the gentlemen’s rules of a snowball fight, how to ice axe arrest, move on ice and snow and 
how to judge snow conditions incase they are dangerously yellow. Hamzah, Ruth and Fresher set off 
on their siege attempt of Invernookie (III) and Tom, Ben and Kip began what they believed to be 
Fingers Ridge (IV) but after Ben spent 2 hours leading a pitch by the seat of his pants it became evident that this was in fact not the case. After a quick reconsideration, the group bravely ran away, 
away to Red Gully (III) on the right before the ground steepened and became a crux pitch of what 
turned out to Fingers Ridge Direct (VII). The main party reconvened at the car park and headed home 
to construct a dish resembling a pasta carbonara and were eventually joined by the Invernookie team. 
There was much rejoicing. 
 

On the second day, Kevin was met at the car park and the novices set off to do their first route, Aladdin’s Couloir (I) and much fun was had. Tom, Ben 
and Kip set off to try Aladdin’s mirror direct (IV), with Tom dispatching the 
crux ice pitch in his standard visually pleasing manor. Team snow hole +1 
went to do the Runnel (II) and, after Hamzah pretended to be a sledge for a 
bit, abseiled back down and responsibly had Hamzah checked over by a 
mechanic to have the dents beaten out. After it was made apparent that all 
was well, chili was consumed by all, and there was much rejoicing. 
 

Having completed their instruction, it was time for the novices to shed the surly bonds of snow and get on the rock. After a pre dawn walk in and it 
becoming apparent that John and Knut are in fact powered by uranium, Tom 
and Ben bravely lead two novices each (Knut, Jo, Joel and John) up Hidden 
Chimney (III). This was a successful venture with both teams topping out at 
around midday. These were soon joined by Kip and Tim (whose name is Tim) 
who had successfully lead the Runnel (II) and retrieved the gear and axes left 
by the previous days tobogganing. As the weather was so glorious, and the 
day was but young, an assent of Cairngorm was devised. Pairs geared up and 
battled up the tough 40º incline. Once summited people became happy, then 
naked, then happy. Fresher, Hamzah and Ruth had a rest day. There was 
much rejoicing. 

Winter skipped spring and summer and became autumn and conditions become unclimbable. A team of elite connoisseurs ventured to the Tomatin distillery car park, 
and eventually visitor’s centre. Once all the available 
knowledge and whisky had been absorbed a historically 
accurate roast dinner of biblical proportion was made and 
consumed followed by enough pudding to fill an ant the size 
of a house. There was much rejoicing. 
 
As the weather was still awful, a trip to Newtyle Quarry was commissioned. After some dry tooling and the 
invention of the crampon smear and running man 
techniques, it was determined that the weather was indeed 
awful. The trip bravely ran away, away to the pub. After 
some cracking nosh and a pint or two the trip reconvened 
back at the house. A game of hide and seek later and diner 
was ready. People became hungry, then happy, then full. 
The following events that followed were a bit too much like 
fun to be mentioned in a Scottish winter report, needless to say that several ventured to Aviemore’s 
finest after dinner amusement, The Vault (VI). There was much rejoicing. 
 
Friday came and still the bad weather persisted. Some people went shopping, then some other people went shopping. Later, after hours of graft, Tim invented the snowball cocktail. Some people watched 
TV, someone did some work, some people talked of how they should do work. Eventually a traditional 
Christmas dinner of spaghetti bolognaise was eaten and it was time for the ICMC secret Santa. People 
became happy, then thankful, then Joel became sad. There was much rejoicing. 
 

On Sunday we left. There was much rejoicing.
