## Day 1

Although each of the seven tour members were departing from different locations about the
country, everyone managed to get to Gloucester for around 1pm on the 2nd January. From here we
packed up the cars and headed off to North Wales and the St Mary’s hut. The roads were fairly icy
and snowy and so going was fairly slow. However, everyone managed to arrive at the hut around
8pm. A fire was started as quickly as possible to heat up the ice cold hut!

## Day 2

The first day of climbing and the group split into two with Al, Lisa, Alex and Ed heading off to explore
the local trad crags, while Danny, Tom and Joe drove up to the much famed ‘cave of justice’.
Although there had been some rain and snow the days before both groups had good dry rock and
lots of good climbing was done.

## Day 3

Conditions were a bit dryer the next day and everyone headed off to a nearby crag to try some
multi-pitch climbing. That is after the hour or so of pushing the cars up the snowy and icy track
outside the hut, with the landrover racing ahead! After a good while scrambling around and
discussing (or arguing?!) where the routes started everyone managed to get going. For Lisa and Alex
this was their first multi-pitch experience and they coped very well with Lisa leading the final pitch of
her climb. After everyone was down in one piece Al and Joe decided that with an hour of sun left they would attempt another route. What at first looked like a route in fact turned into a gardening
expedition! However, only one piece of gear was lost and both returned down in one piece, albeit in
the darkness.

## Day 4

Rain hit overnight and so it was decided that bouldering was the safest option. A quick drive to
Llanberis pass revealed the boulder field snowed under. That’s when the mayhem began. Snowballs
began flying from every direction as climbers found cover behind the problems they were planning
on attempting. Some beautiful head shots were achieved by throwing blind over cover until Ed
returned with lunch in the Landrover. The decision was then made to drive to a fairly far off crag on
the coast where it was hoped that the weather would be better. It wasn’t! Still some of the
beginners managed to get their first experience of bouldering in the snow and a couple of the older
members had a nice swim in the sea!

Lisa and Alex left this evening

## Day 5

Again conditions were better and everyone headed off together. The first problem struck when
Danny realized he was driving on a flat tyre! So the tyre was replaced and we headed back to the
hut. Then on our way back out Al’s car came a cropper on the ice and one tyre was slashed! With
two cars hobbling we decided to head to the nearest city and replace all the damaged wheels. With
lots of frustrated climbers itching to get on some rock it was decided to go back to Parisella’s cave
and attempt some night bouldering! This worked great with a land rover parked facing the crag with
the lights on and some excellent climbing was had. After getting home to the hut the traditional
roast dinner was started... four hours later at about midnight dinner was served! After everyone had
woken up and eaten, a fair system was implemented to decide whom should wash up – the loser of
a game of forks. The president, Tom was so keen to avoid the washing up, that he stabbed Al with
the fork in order to ensure his safety from the greasy pans. Finally everyone went to bed tired but
cheerful.

## Day 6

On the final day we decided to try and get some more climbing done in the morning and headed to
the local bouldering area in the Llanberis pass. Most boulders were topped with snow but a few bits
were under cover and some decent climbing was had by all. Then we all headed home and everyone
got back without incident.


In conclusion, the tour was a success. No fundamental changes to the trip organisation are
recommended although perhaps a greater appreciation of the weather conditions could have been
useful, both in the areas of travel as well as climbing conditions.

Financially, the trip made a marginal profit (£7!). We spent no money on accommodation, we spent
£259 on food and a total of £250 on petrol. We received £167 in grants from the union and changed
£50 for the trip

Climbing was done every day and an excellent time was had by all.
