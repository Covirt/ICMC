## The Journey
Due to ultra efficiency from Johan and the shopping crew the bus was ready to go at 18:05,
unfortunately no one was actually here at this point, mainly due to coursework and lectures.
Departure occurred some 20 minutes later. Most importantly Outdoor Club (S&G) where still
putting bags on their roof as we burnt away from the union. The journey was uneventful apart from
a slight deviation from the planned route around stoke. Eliot’s car and the bus arrived at the
campsite within a few minutes of each other due to the car stopping for ice cream.

## Day 1
Fresher and I went to Jamtastic Ramshaw Rocks while everyone else went to the Roaches. I lead
Phallic Crack (S) and Battle of Bulge (VS). On Battle of the Bulge I entertainingly kicked out my first
gear as I moved past it and proceeded to place very suspect runners to the top. I then proceeded to
be a little silly and fail to start the crank, I will return. Fresher the lead a severe crack, finding it
pleasant and jammy.
At the Roaches lots of teaching and fun climbing/bouldering went on.

## Day 2
The start was heavily delayed by faff and destination selection but eventually we ended up at the
slightly damp Roaches. Lizze lead the crazy run out VS that Johan had lead the day before. Quite a
few people got stuck into a jamming roof crack boulder problem that Fresher had found, loosing alot
of skin in the process. Top knots were declared the best hair style for jamming. Murray did the hard
move on ‘The Boss’ (f6c) only to fall off the easier upper moves, it was that kind of day.


## The Race
We stopped for take away in Stoke. The food varied from cheap and mostly disgusting (Ali’s) to
quite good pizza with a middling price. At Ali’s a one of the local tramps decided that it was time to
tell everyone which bits of London he had been too (Peckham, Wandsworth and Knightsbridge
apparently).
Further down the motorway we stopped for a toilet break at Harvester only to see Fellwander’s bus
in the car park. Some aggressive driving and loud Tokyo Drift latter they knew that it was on. We
allowed them the start and they continued to pull away from us due to an estimated 0.5Mph speed
advantage on their speed limiter. However roadwork’s with average speed check and some crazy
weaving and shortest path taking put us back ahead. Fellwander’s presumably knowing that we
would just defeat them in London if they managed to get ahead using their speed limiter advantage
bailed onto the M1 and its inevitable congestion.
At the union the entertainment was provided by the door to stores been broken and therefore gear
was left for the night in the bus. Even after all this faff the Fellwanders had still not got back,
presumably they enjoy traffic jams.
