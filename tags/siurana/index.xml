&lt;h2 id="objectives"&gt;Objectives
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For everyone to enjoy 2 weeks of sport climbing in the sun!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For members to improve their sport climbing ability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To experience and take advantage of a much better standard of sport climbing than
is available in the UK.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no doubt that the tour fulfilled its objectives. Everyone had a great time, the quality
of sport climbing was excellent, and many people boosted their sport climbing grade by a
substantial amount; Sam and Milan boosted their grades from 6a+ to 6c and I went from
climbing 6c+ to 7b.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="friday-september-6th"&gt;Friday, September 6th
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first seven of us took our flight in today. Hamzah reinforced his position of club chopper
by trying to bring the most lethal looking ice screw I’ve ever seen onto the plane. The
security were nice enough not to arrest him, but he did lose his ice-screw-dagger. We
arrived in Reus at around 8pm and from there took a taxi straight to the campsite in Siurana.
We were immediately greeted by the campsite owners who were really friendly, and kept
the kitchen open late to get us all fed! After choosing our rooms in the campsite cabins and
moving all our stuff in, we went to bed setting an alarm for an early start tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="saturday-september-7th"&gt;Saturday, September 7th
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A thunderstorm looming overhead
prevented people from doing much
climbing in the morning&amp;hellip; off to a good
start! Andy and I (Will) set off hitch-hiking
to the nearby town Cornudella, to buy food
supplies for the next few days. Other than
getting hopelessly lost and accidentally
hitch-hiking to a huge dam this was
successful. Meanwhile the rest of the
group spent the day slacklining and
meeting other climbers on the campsite.
Hannes – one guy we met – was kind
enough to drive some of us to a crag later
on in the day when it had dried out.
Cheehan, Dak and Rosanna arrived today!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sunday-september-8th"&gt;Sunday, September 8th
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are all up early to head to a nearby
crag – Can Marges - which has a range
of easy and hard routes for the day.
Everyone gets a good few climbs in. At
midday it gets really hot so we have a
break, and after another thunderstorm
at 5 we head back. This was our first
real go on Spanish rock as a group, and
everyone founds the climbs hard. This
rock will take some getting used to!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/summer-tour-2013/images/2.jpg" width="300"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="monday-september-9th"&gt;Monday, September 9th
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bulk of the group headed to Can Parasit to
climb in the morning. We were lucky to have
Hannes to drive some of us into town for food
shopping! Everyone regroups at the campsite at 4
and then heads back out to Can Parasit. Some of
us take fall practice to get confidence sport
climbing and some hard routes are attempted
until it gets dark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/summer-tour-2013/images/3.jpg" width="300"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tuesday-september-10th"&gt;Tuesday, September 10th
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Up super early. Scrambled eggs. The majority of people leave to Can Parasit again as it was
popular yesterday. Me Amar Michael and Hannes drive to Arboli, a beautiful crag just out of
walking distance. We climb a variety of routes ranging from 6a to 7b+. We had something
loosely resembling Piella for tea, took advantage of the unpolluted sky stargazing, then all
retreated to bed!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="wednesday-september-11th"&gt;Wednesday, September 11th
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We spent the day at Grau del Masetes. There was a nice section of wall with a range of
easier routes that became the social hub of the crag. Lunch was Local baguettes with a
monstrous portion of nutella. Michael won chopper of the day award by trying to climb one
face of a chimney problem making it magnitudes harder, and benighting a small group of us
by getting a rope stuck at the top of a route!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="thursday-september-12th"&gt;Thursday, September 12th
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We went to Grau del Masetes again. A portion of the
day was spent trying a 6a and 6a+ overhang at the
‘social hub’ of the crag. We also spent a long time all
trying a classic 6b nearby, with Michael taking photos
from a rope he had set up next to the route.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="friday-september-13th"&gt;Friday, September 13th
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rest day today! Much slacklining was done! A number of people visited Siurana village
during the day. Charlie, Sam, Will Smith, Milan and Jack arrived later today. Amar had to go
back, and the campsite owners were kind enough to offer to drive him all the way to Reus
themselves! (A two hour round trip)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="saturday-september-14th"&gt;Saturday, September 14th
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a morning excursion through a small jungle to a crag we wrongly thought would be big
enough for all of us, we headed to Can Melafots. This is the famous crag at Siurana, and with
good reason! It consists of a long stretch of amazing overhanging red rock, overlooking a
beautiful view of the lake nearby. It was obvious this crag would be visited many more times
this trip!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sunday-september-15th"&gt;Sunday, September 15th
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Due to a number of complaints about it being too hot, some people went to a shaded crag,
Reserva India. The rest of the group headed to Can Melafots again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="monday-september-16th"&gt;Monday, September 16th
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We spent the day at Grau del Masetes, to show the new-comers the crag. A number of
people had a go at a short 7a+ with a really hard boulder move at the top. Only Jack got it!
Since everyone feels pretty spent we decided upon a rest day tomorrow. This is great news
because it allows us to indulge in all the Spanish wine we can get our hands on with no fear
of climbing hung-over!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tuesday-september-17th"&gt;Tuesday, September 17th
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally a full rest-day! Everyone had a big lie-in and then we trekked down to the lake for
some swimming. A herd of goats pestered us when we were all sitting by the lake. From the
lake we headed to Town to buy food and have a few drinks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="wednesday-september-18th"&gt;Wednesday September 18th
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Me, Antje, Will Smith, Charlie, Milan, Jack and Jakov left early to go to the crag El Detot. The
rest were chilling out or climbing at Can Melafots. Michael got his 7c project, and I got a 7a I
had been trying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="thursday-september-19th"&gt;Thursday September 19th
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today is the last day of real climbing! Everyone with projects they want to do has to get the
today! Me and Michael had a 7b and 7c+ project at Can Melafots to finish. I got the 7b and
was given a gummy-bear as a reward. We all drank a lot with dinner and for some reason
had a food-fight with spaghetti&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="friday-september-20th"&gt;Friday September 20th
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We got the campsite owners to order us a taxi for 3:30. The morning was spent packing and
clearing up the huts, primarily removing spaghetti from the walls. We had quite a large
amount of euros left over so thought we would splash out on a nice meal for lunch! We
went to a pizzeria in Siurana Village with Hannes before saying bye and heading off!&lt;/p&gt;
