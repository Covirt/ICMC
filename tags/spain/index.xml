&lt;h2 id="aims-and-objectives"&gt;Aims and objectives
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To pull hard on the amazing rock climbs in the valleys
surrounding Chulilla; a very popular, new climbing
area in southern Spain. Many of the members had
never climbed outdoors before so another aim was to
teach them how to safely operate ropes and deal with
the situations that arise from climbing outdoors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-1"&gt;Day 1
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a crazily early start (or all-nighter in the case of
the members returning from the peak district trip) to
catch the 7:30 flight to Valencia, the group managed
to pull together enough psych to go and climb on the
roadside crags in Chulilla. This gave the perfect taste
of the week ahead, lovely limestone climbs, well
bolted routes, and lots of laughter. A trip to the shops
for cheap Spanish wine was undertaken. Food was
also found, and the group enjoyed a warm evening
inside before heading to bed early.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-2"&gt;Day 2
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a breakfast of porridge (described as the
most meagre portion of porridge ever by one
member) the group headed to the crag. A nice
morning in the shade was had, teaching people
all of the key safety aspects of route cleaning
and other such fun. Alex and Richard went off
to climb a simple multipitch in the afternoon
whilst the rest of the group climbed some
more on the shorter walls before enjoying the
cooling river and a slackline session. Alex and
Richard were having way more fun as they had
decided abseiling was lame, and they would
walk off the top of their route. 3 hours later
and an abseil through a bramble bush they get
back onto the path, dehydrated and
knackered. An enjoyable meal and bonding
session was had in the evening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-3"&gt;Day 3
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;REST DayYYYY. The group headed to a different sector and
had a nice morning of easy climbing to cure their
hangovers. Lunch was had at an incredible swimming area
with beautiful limestone caves hiding behind the
waterfalls. The group then decided clothes were lame and
posed for a centre fold picture. Some preceded to stay
naked for a lot longer than was necessary. Supplies were
gathered for another night and the group had an
incredible BBQ before building a fire and spending the
evening outside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-4"&gt;Day 4
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A day jam packed with crushing, single and multi-pitch
climbing along with some idiocy from the future president.
Everyone was feeling refreshed and full of psych. Two groups headed off to try some multi pitch
early in the morning. Richard and Hannah flew up their route whilst Charlotte and Shan dawdled up
theirs. Everyone else climbed at a new crag, got very hot and then left in search of food. The group
reassembled for lunch and then Alex, Stuart and Richard headed off to try something hard in the
Sex-Shop sector. The aptly named Eco-Dildo was the route of choice and the three guys stayed late
trying for the send. Richard was a moron and didn’t take any quickdraws with him so downclimbed
the crux on his flash attempt before coming down screaming. Stuart then crushed and flashed a
grade he’d never climbed before (what a wad). Alex was weak. Everyone reconvened at the house
for a delicious Bolognese.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-5"&gt;Day 5
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was the last day of climbing for the group; people were sad and exhausted. This didn’t stop them
though. Stuart crushed again; flashing another 7a. Everyone pulled hard on routes and could be
proud of what they achieved across the week. An early dinner of stir fry was had before another fire
and more wine was enjoyed. Some youths were staying next door and at 4am Mert went full dad
mode and told them to shut off the music. He also made the group sandwiches, which were
incredible and well needed at the airport the following morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/easter-tour-2018/images/5.jpg"
alt="An enjoyable evening for all" width="300"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-6"&gt;Day 6
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glassy eyed and a bit broken the group arose at 6am to travel home. At the airport the group
wallowed in self-pity but no regrets at Burger King before boarding the flight back to London.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="objectives"&gt;Objectives
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For everyone to enjoy 2 weeks of sport climbing in the sun!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For members to improve their sport climbing ability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To experience and take advantage of a much better standard of sport climbing than
is available in the UK.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no doubt that the tour fulfilled its objectives. Everyone had a great time, the quality
of sport climbing was excellent, and many people boosted their sport climbing grade by a
substantial amount; Sam and Milan boosted their grades from 6a+ to 6c and I went from
climbing 6c+ to 7b.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id="friday-september-6th"&gt;Friday, September 6th
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first seven of us took our flight in today. Hamzah reinforced his position of club chopper
by trying to bring the most lethal looking ice screw I’ve ever seen onto the plane. The
security were nice enough not to arrest him, but he did lose his ice-screw-dagger. We
arrived in Reus at around 8pm and from there took a taxi straight to the campsite in Siurana.
We were immediately greeted by the campsite owners who were really friendly, and kept
the kitchen open late to get us all fed! After choosing our rooms in the campsite cabins and
moving all our stuff in, we went to bed setting an alarm for an early start tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="saturday-september-7th"&gt;Saturday, September 7th
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A thunderstorm looming overhead
prevented people from doing much
climbing in the morning&amp;hellip; off to a good
start! Andy and I (Will) set off hitch-hiking
to the nearby town Cornudella, to buy food
supplies for the next few days. Other than
getting hopelessly lost and accidentally
hitch-hiking to a huge dam this was
successful. Meanwhile the rest of the
group spent the day slacklining and
meeting other climbers on the campsite.
Hannes – one guy we met – was kind
enough to drive some of us to a crag later
on in the day when it had dried out.
Cheehan, Dak and Rosanna arrived today!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/summer-tour-2013/images/0.jpg"

&lt;p&gt;Hamzah showing off his slacklining skills&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sunday-september-8th"&gt;Sunday, September 8th
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are all up early to head to a nearby
crag – Can Marges - which has a range
of easy and hard routes for the day.
Everyone gets a good few climbs in. At
midday it gets really hot so we have a
break, and after another thunderstorm
at 5 we head back. This was our first
real go on Spanish rock as a group, and
everyone founds the climbs hard. This
rock will take some getting used to!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/summer-tour-2013/images/2.jpg" width="300"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="monday-september-9th"&gt;Monday, September 9th
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bulk of the group headed to Can Parasit to
climb in the morning. We were lucky to have
Hannes to drive some of us into town for food
shopping! Everyone regroups at the campsite at 4
and then heads back out to Can Parasit. Some of
us take fall practice to get confidence sport
climbing and some hard routes are attempted
until it gets dark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/summer-tour-2013/images/3.jpg" width="300"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tuesday-september-10th"&gt;Tuesday, September 10th
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Up super early. Scrambled eggs. The majority of people leave to Can Parasit again as it was
popular yesterday. Me Amar Michael and Hannes drive to Arboli, a beautiful crag just out of
walking distance. We climb a variety of routes ranging from 6a to 7b+. We had something
loosely resembling Piella for tea, took advantage of the unpolluted sky stargazing, then all
retreated to bed!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="wednesday-september-11th"&gt;Wednesday, September 11th
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We spent the day at Grau del Masetes. There was a nice section of wall with a range of
easier routes that became the social hub of the crag. Lunch was Local baguettes with a
monstrous portion of nutella. Michael won chopper of the day award by trying to climb one
face of a chimney problem making it magnitudes harder, and benighting a small group of us
by getting a rope stuck at the top of a route!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="thursday-september-12th"&gt;Thursday, September 12th
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We went to Grau del Masetes again. A portion of the
day was spent trying a 6a and 6a+ overhang at the
‘social hub’ of the crag. We also spent a long time all
trying a classic 6b nearby, with Michael taking photos
from a rope he had set up next to the route.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="friday-september-13th"&gt;Friday, September 13th
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rest day today! Much slacklining was done! A number of people visited Siurana village
during the day. Charlie, Sam, Will Smith, Milan and Jack arrived later today. Amar had to go
back, and the campsite owners were kind enough to offer to drive him all the way to Reus
themselves! (A two hour round trip)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/summer-tour-2013/images/10.jpg"

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="saturday-september-14th"&gt;Saturday, September 14th
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a morning excursion through a small jungle to a crag we wrongly thought would be big
enough for all of us, we headed to Can Melafots. This is the famous crag at Siurana, and with
good reason! It consists of a long stretch of amazing overhanging red rock, overlooking a
beautiful view of the lake nearby. It was obvious this crag would be visited many more times
this trip!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sunday-september-15th"&gt;Sunday, September 15th
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Due to a number of complaints about it being too hot, some people went to a shaded crag,
Reserva India. The rest of the group headed to Can Melafots again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="monday-september-16th"&gt;Monday, September 16th
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We spent the day at Grau del Masetes, to show the new-comers the crag. A number of
people had a go at a short 7a+ with a really hard boulder move at the top. Only Jack got it!
Since everyone feels pretty spent we decided upon a rest day tomorrow. This is great news
because it allows us to indulge in all the Spanish wine we can get our hands on with no fear
of climbing hung-over!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tuesday-september-17th"&gt;Tuesday, September 17th
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally a full rest-day! Everyone had a big lie-in and then we trekked down to the lake for
some swimming. A herd of goats pestered us when we were all sitting by the lake. From the
lake we headed to Town to buy food and have a few drinks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="wednesday-september-18th"&gt;Wednesday September 18th
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Me, Antje, Will Smith, Charlie, Milan, Jack and Jakov left early to go to the crag El Detot. The
rest were chilling out or climbing at Can Melafots. Michael got his 7c project, and I got a 7a I
had been trying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="thursday-september-19th"&gt;Thursday September 19th
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today is the last day of real climbing! Everyone with projects they want to do has to get the
today! Me and Michael had a 7b and 7c+ project at Can Melafots to finish. I got the 7b and
was given a gummy-bear as a reward. We all drank a lot with dinner and for some reason
had a food-fight with spaghetti&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="friday-september-20th"&gt;Friday September 20th
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We got the campsite owners to order us a taxi for 3:30. The morning was spent packing and
clearing up the huts, primarily removing spaghetti from the walls. We had quite a large
amount of euros left over so thought we would splash out on a nice meal for lunch! We
went to a pizzeria in Siurana Village with Hannes before saying bye and heading off!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="1-introduction"&gt;1 Introduction
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the Easter break of 2011 members of Imperial College Mountaineering Club (ICMC) departed
on a 14 day trip that would take them through 3 different countries in their quest for climbing.
Taking the union minibus these brave adventurers drove 2276 miles through tunnels, over
mountains, off road and even on the flat. Due to several members dropping out and several other
members lacking just one of the requirements to be able to drive there were only two drivers of the
minibus for the duration of the trip. Most of the team returned with no injuries&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were several aims and objectives for the tour, primary aim of the tour were to take members
of the club to a number of locations and climb on a range of rock types and in styles unusual to that
of the UK. Other aims were for members to improve their ability and to climb in styles that they
were not so used to. The Pyrenees also offered some longer multipitch climbs that are far larger
than anything available in the UK and these were the main target of some members of the tour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four distinctly different rock types were seen on tour, these were limestone, sand stone, granite and
conglomerate however within these broad rock types there were a range of styles from slabs to
overhangs. All members felt they had improved and were stronger towards the end of the trip.
Certain crags offered very interesting routes which combined different styles of climbing such as
steep over hangs into technical slabs which was very rewarding to climb on. While multi pitch climbs
were done by all members the attempt at Enfants de la Dalle (a 1000m+ route) was called off for
concerns about the safety of the attempt. The Pyrenees mountain range has a lot to offer in the way
of climbing, another tour could easily be run and not have to climb in any of the same areas. It would
also be of value to return in the future and climb some of the routes that defeated the climbers this
time around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For future tours there are some lessons to be learnt. While taking the minibus is a reasonable way to
travel it is slower and more tiring than flying. The minibus did have the major advantages of being
able to take all of the equipment and did allow the tour to visit a lot more areas than would have
been practical if flights had been used. The main problem was the lack of drivers, only having two
drivers meant that they were very tired at the end of long stretches of driving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A final issue, which only became apparent after the tour was finished, was the amount of things
done on tour. So much was crammed into the 14 days that an extensive tour report was required to
describe the events of the tour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="2-people"&gt;2 People
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The people who went on the tour were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Matthew Lees (Murray)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edward Stott&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tristan Pollitt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jonathan Price&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Elliot Carrington (Choss Master)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adrian Jeakins*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Michael Jones (Fails)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jonathan Mason (The American)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Justine Courty*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All people on the tour were full members of ICMC at the time&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*These members were not present for the entire trip&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="3-tour-diary"&gt;3 Tour Diary
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id="31-day-1--beit"&gt;3.1 Day 1 – Beit
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While most students were finishing up for the term and moving over to the union to relax and have
a few drinks before going home for Easter the ICMC members were busy packing the bus and getting
ready for their 2 weeks away. Murray had spent the morning chasing various Sabbaticals and union
staff for money, bus keys and tarps and had managed to get it all together in time for the bus to be
packed and make a slightly delayed departure at 7 pm. Heading towards the euro tunnel took from
South Kensington took the bus through central London which was packed. Eventually the motor way
was reached and the lack of a 6th gear became annoyingly obvious with the engine droning away in
5 th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The euro tunnel was reached in remarkably good time considering the traffic and late get away. The
spare hour was used by most to wonder around the terminal but Ed took this opportunity to climb
on top of the bus and have a snooze. The train was boarded just before midnight and departed on
time&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="32-day-2--font"&gt;3.2 Day 2 – Font
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arriving in France shortly after departing and not
being entirely sure of the time anymore Ed took the
wheel and headed towards Fontainebleau; we
arrived much earlier than expected. Since it was
still dark all the members decided to find their own
sleeping spots and have a good sleep before the
day’s bouldering. Some members slept in the bus,
some in the woods, and Ed chose the top of the bus
again. The people who had chosen to sleep in the
woods were woken first by the numerous dogs that
went to investigate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a good breakfast of cereal the group moved
off into the forest to find the boulders they had
come looking for. Murray, Ed, Fails and Choss
Master set off on the purple circuit which proved to
be just the right difficulty. There were some
interesting problems as well as a high ball part and
an impressive tunnel to crawl through. At lunch
time the 4 decided to head back to base camp for
food and while walking back Choss Master had a
disagreement with a rock, the disagreement escalated into a fight. Choss Master decided that the
best option was to head but the rock but this proved to be a bad idea. After sending someone for ice
at the cafe and making Choss Master sit still for a while they continued back to base camp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That afternoon Fails found an impressive looking roof section that he managed to climb after a few
goes, Murray and Choss Master both climbed it afterwards. Ed and Jon both slept on top of the roof
being climbed while The American did some impressive spotting for those on the roof. After
everyone had climbed themselves out for the day they got back on the bus and headed for
Targasonne stopping in some services for Chilli.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="33-day-3--targasonne"&gt;3.3 Day 3 – Targasonne
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;After some more speedy driving at 100 kph by Ed and Murray Targasonne was reached ahead of
schedule and again people decided to sleep by the road instead of going straight for the climbing.
Just when everyone had got to sleep it began to rain, most people dived straight into the bus but Jon
and Ed had other ideas, they slipped under the bus to use it as a shelter and both slept there. A
couple of hours later an angry French man turned up and told us we were in the wrong place, the
bouldering was further out of town, and he told us to get out of the lay-by we were in. Seeing the
rain hadn’t stopped and not wanting to get in trouble the decision was made to make a break for the
border. On the way there was a rather long tunnel and the tunnel game was introduced to all (where
one holds their breath while in the tunnel), unfortunately the 13 km tunnel proved far too long for
anyone to finish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later that day the bus rolled into their new home for the next week and set up camp, this time in the
right place. On the Spanish side the weather was much more favourable with no sign of rain, not
wanting to waste the rest of the day everyone jumped back into the bus and went to the closest crag
that had things easier than 7a; Crestes De Conill. After getting spanked by the easiest of climbs and
blaming it on being tired and on unusual rock the team returned to the campsite. Homemade
burgers were on the menu that evening, after burning all of them in an effort to avoid food
poisoning everyone turned in for the first good night’s sleep to be had in a couple of days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="34-day-4--conglomerate"&gt;3.4 Day 4 – Conglomerate
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;After waking up to surprisingly good health after dinner the night before a relaxed pace was adopted
for this days climbing. The destination was an area called Collegats, quite a large area of
conglomerate climbing. Most of the routs had a boulder start, easy middle and a difficult top section.
The conglomerate rock had an interesting mix of hidden jugs and a lot of traps. Fails and Choss
Master decided to demonstrate their punter like skills by setting up a top rope on a 6c and did not
attempt the lead. Murray tried a 6a on lead but had to retreat and let fails rescue his quick draws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some refreshing rain started at the end of the day making the decision to end climbing and go back
to camp for everyone. Dinner that night was a tuna and tomato pasta dish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="35-day-5--lleida"&gt;3.5 Day 5 – Lleida
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was the first time breakfast had been porridge on
the trip. The plan was to have a rest day and go into
Lleida to pick up Adrian who had flown in late after
needing to finish project work. In Lleida the food
supplies were restocked and lunch consisted of 2 Kg of
mystery meat purchased at the reasonable sum of €4.
Decathlon was next on the shopping trip for people to
restock on climbing equipment they had decided they
needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a phone call from Adrian saying there was a delay
and he would be getting into Lleida 2 hours later than
originally planned the idea of a rest day was scrapped
and the guide book was reached for. The closest
climbing to Lleida was a cave with a number of routs
ranging from 8a to unclimbed, deciding this was a bit
hard bouldering a bit further away was chosen. After
about half an hour driving on a dirt track into the desert
leaving a massive dust cloud in the wake of the bus the
boulders were discovered with the tell tale chalk of a
long history of being climbed. A number of hard
powerful problems were climbed and many remained
unclimbed even after ridiculous back breaking beta was
used. Once Adrian was picked up from the train station
and the short journey back to camp completed dinner
was put on, this time it was carbonara.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="36-day-6--accident"&gt;3.6 Day 6 – Accident
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The destination for climbing this day was Camarossa. Being a road side crag made access very easy,
luckily the road lead to a hydro electric plant and had very little traffic on it. Being at the bottom of a
valley there was no direct sun for much of the day. Fails had spotted a short 6c+ that had a powerful
crux, ideal for the Westway climber. After some working he eventually got it clean, attempts were
made by Murray and Choss Master but were unsuccessful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While climbing elsewhere Ed took a rather large lob (4 – 5 m) whilst trying to clip a bolt.
Unfortunately during the fall he inverted in the harness and hit his head on the rock below, he was
not wearing a helmet at the time. At first glance the injury was quite bad; there was a lot of blood on
Ed and the rock. On closer inspection while the cut was deep it was not through to the skull so it was
bandaged up. Within a short period Ed was feeling much better but decided not to climb anymore
that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further up the road from the crag was an interesting looking cave which had a couple of inches of
water in the bottom. The cave was large enough for a car to drive down and the tell tale tyre marks
at the entrance confirmed this had been done. The cave extended about 100 m into the rock, made
a turn and ended. It was concluded that this was a secret government facility with a concealed
entrance and we would all disappear if exploration continued. Dinner that evening was a BBQ which
was enjoyed by all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="37-day-7--schorchio"&gt;3.7 Day 7 – Schorchio!
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The morning was spent in the town of Balaguer stocking up on food. While the team were shopping
Fails took decided to go for a haircut. On the return from the hairdressers to the bus he managed to
get lost and needed to be rescued by Ed. Fully stocked the team left the town to find some climbing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After parking next to a bee hive the team walked up to the climbs at Cubells. This was by far the
hottest day of the trip. The crag was south facing and right a t the end of the foot hills, from the base
of the walk in the land was flat for as far as the eye could see. While the climbing was very good the
heat was exhausting and the constant bees following the climbers up the crag were annoying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Returning to camp a curry was cooked up
and eaten in very little time. Just before
going to bed some members decided to
take showers, one of these members was
Fails. It turned out that fails had forgotten
his towel and thought that the best
solution was to dance in front of the hand
dryer in his boxers until fully dried. This
matter was not aided by people flicking
water at him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="38-day-8--birthday"&gt;3.8 Day 8 – Birthday
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a day of being roasted by the Spanish
sun a rest day was called for. Various
activities were devised by members.
Revision was a popular idea but very little
was achieved. Some members went on a
walk around the camp site and found a
chain of 65 caterpillars following each
other nose to tail. Attempts to join the 2
ends of the chain together failed so they
were left alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later a trip was organised into Balaguer to restock on food again. While in town the idea of ice
creams was put forwards, unfortunately at a mere 32 o the local ice cream shop felt it was too cold
for anyone to buy ice creams and had not opened. While wondering around town a rather unusual
shop was discovered that had many sweet
deals, fails was in heaven and splashed out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once all the entertainments of Balaguer were
exhausted swimming in the river was suggested
and all members agreed this was a perfect way
to cool off, near to the camp site was a lake that
looked ideal. At the entrance to the lake a small
bridge crossed, at approximately 5 m high it was
a good height for jumping into the river from.
After extensive testing by throwing rocks of
various size into the river it was deemed safe
enough for Fails to jump in. Driving the minibus
off the bridge and into the river was also put
forwards as a more conclusive test but the
barriers next to the road prevented this. After
Fails jumped into the water with a small Spanish
audience and survived it was then considered
safe enough for the other more valuable
members to enter. Murray took the longest to get over his psyche problem but did jump in the
end. The water was very cold and quick exits
were made by all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some issues with the stoves catching fire
due to leaky petrol canisters chilli was served
but, rather unusually for ICMC, there was also a
desert on offer. The desert was a quadruple
chocolate cake hand crafted for The American’s
birthday. It consisted of 2 chocolate sponges
glued together with melted chocolate, covered
in more melted chocolate, with chocolate eggs
on top each with a soft chocolate centre.
Candles were fashioned from the left over
cheese wax wrapped around sticks and soaked
in petrol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="39-day-9--policía"&gt;3.9 Day 9 – Policía
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was to be the last day spent in Spain. The
tent was packed up with impressive speed and
everything was ready to go so fast that the
reception was not yet open. After waiting for
reception to open and paying for the camp site
ICMC was on the road again. Heading north
towards France they stopped to check out
Pachamama, Chris Sharma’s famous 9a+, all
were amazed at the size of it and how over hanging it was. While having lunch it was realised that
more people had been to the moon than had climbed that piece of rock. With that sobering thought
they got back on the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crag for the day was located on an abandoned stretch of highway that was left to crumble after
the new highway was constructed that tunnelled straight through the rock rather than winding
around the valley. The abandoned highway could easily be from a scene in a post apocalyptic film
and as such everyone was on guard for zombies or gangs who might want our supplies. The walk up
to the crag was steep and had a lot of loose rock, once at the top everyone immediately found a
bush to hide behind as the sun was beating down again. Finishing climbing early as there was still a
lot of driving to do that day they got back on the road and played the tunnel game, again being
defeated by the 13 km monster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While on the road heading towards France the bus was waved over by the policía, they asked for the
drivers licence and there seemed to be some problem with it not being valid for the type of vehicle
being driven. Trying to explain it only had 9 seats so was not category D failed due to the language
barrier. One of the policía seemed interested in what we had on the room and after shouts of
“escalada” their attitude changed and they waved us on. Deciding that they would not hang around
long enough for the policía to change their mind they made a break for the border. There was an
interesting detour from the main road that the sat-nav seemed to think was better, while being a lot more picturesque it was unclear if it was any faster. Arriving at the very cheap camping municipal
after a long hill climb in the bus the team settled down for what might be a rather cold night due to
the altitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="310-day-10--la-dent-dorlu"&gt;3.10 Day 10 – La Dent d’Orlu
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Waking up to a surprisingly warm morning considering the altitude the first views of the new scenery
were seen and impressed all. There was still snow on top of many of the mountains and the ski lift
was running. The plan for the day was to check out a mountain called La Dent d’Orlu, on the south
and east faces were many multi pitch climbs, one of which was of particular interest: Les Enfants de
la Dalle. This rout had been chosen by Murray and Jon as their main target for the tour, the total
height was 1100 m of rock made of 28 pitches all needing to be done in 1 day. Today was going to be
a reconnaissance trip in order to climb some smaller routes and work out where then needed to be
for the main ascent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The town of Aux les Thermes was called at for fuel and food before heading to Orlu to find the
mountain. Parking in a large car park at the bottom the first views of the climb were intimidating to
say the least. A huge face of dark stone that looked much higher and steeper than expected with the
top few hundred meters capped in snow greeted the climbers and they had not even done the walk
in yet. The topo suggested a 30 minute walk in but this was more like an hour and 30 up steep
woodland with a difficult to follow path. Reaching the bottom of the climbs a well deserved lunch
was had. Part way through lunch a rock landed a couple of meters away from the happy picnickers,
from the sound it was estimated to be going very fast and about toaster size. Helmets were donned
by all who had them and the guide book was placed over the head of the one member who had left
theirs behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While scoping out routs, rain drops could be felt and the weather looked like it might be about to
take a turn for the worse. Large seepage patches could be seen and few bolts could. The decision
was made to abandon climbing here as it was unsuitable for teaching multipitch and would have
been potentially dangerous even for the experienced climbers. The walk out was no better than the
walk in and would have been near impossible if the sky had opened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A crag much closer to the camp site was located with a good selection of climbs and even some
multipitch. It turned out to be an interesting mix of some technical slab and powerful overhangs and
was very enjoyable. Fails and Choss Master climbed a 6c, when Murray attempted it he slid down
the slab section losing some fingertips. Jon and Murray climbed a multipitch and had a difficult
conversation half way up, they decided that it was not a good idea to climb Enfants as it would be
too dangerous and getting benighted was a certainty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Returning to camp after an exhausting day of walking up hills everyone was in the mood for a less
strenuous day the next day so bouldering was again on the table. Dinner was carbonara.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="311-day-11--the-mountain-pass"&gt;3.11 Day 11 – The Mountain Pass
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deciding to take an easy day after all the fell wondering the day before a group decision was made
to do some hard bouldering Targasonne. Realising that it was on the other side of the 13 km an
alternate route was looked for to avoid the toll, a mountain pass over the tunnel was found which
was open so this became the new route, the sat nav objected heavily. Driving up the zig zagging
roads was reasonably fun until the bus entered fog that was as thick as pea soup, then the drivers realised they had made an amazing decision and the trip was to be a lot more fun. After some time
of driving with about 15 m visibility the bus suddenly left the fog into the sunny clear air on the other
side of the mountain, turning a corner the team got a view of what they had just driven out of. It
looked rather like someone had dropped a large amount of dry ice on France and the smoke was
pouring through the cull.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arriving at Targasonne and not having a guide book meant finding the climbing was rather difficult,
driving along the road many small boulders were pointed out until rounding a corner a gigantic
boulder field appeared and it was obvious where they were meant to go. Parking in a road version of
an oxbow lake, the bus was unloaded and everyone headed off in the direction of the closest
boulders. The plan was to wonder around and find cool looking problems to try and not worry about
grades or what was possible, a plan which proved to be excellent. The first big boulder that base
camp was set up at had a number of problems on which were all enjoyable. The top out appeared
flat when climbing but long chalk streamers ran down the top of the rock that guided the hands to
hidden jugs. People wondered around for a while each picking out their own rocks of interest. Fails
and Adrian found an impressive problem that they spent most of the day working requiring difficult
moves into under cuts and a top out that was not particularly friendly. After many attempts and
almost at the end of the day Adrian almost made an ascent but failed at the final move when he
tried to pull onto the top but found there were only prickly bushes, making a dynamic retreat all the
observers saw his grazed torso caused by the top out. Inspired by this effort fails put a tee-shirt on
and managed to top out the problem grading it V6+ or V7. Several other problems were climbed and
not climbed and overall everyone had a very good day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sharp granite had taken its toll and everyone’s fingertips were feeling very thin. The journey
back involved driving back through the fog again which was no thinner. Dinner that night was
another BBQ. Some members decided to eat in to the next day’s lunch rations and cook some
bananas with chocolate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="312-day-12--choss"&gt;3.12 Day 12 – Choss
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking through the guide book for some multipitch climbs that everyone could do the location
Sinsat 1, Le Pubis, sector GR4B+ was chosen. Upon arriving the discovery was made that the climbs
were half way up a mountain, the long walk in the baking sub began. While walking up the foot path
it was noted that a number of the climbs on different walls could be linked to make a multipitch
ascent which was much longer than the guide book had first indicated, some French climbers were
doing this. The topo used for the Foix area was printed from the internet, if pictures had been
included it would have been easier to identify the crags and it may have been noticed that the
various climbs could be linked up sooner. The climbs were good quality with little polish. This was
some member’s first experience of the slightly sparse nature of multipitch bolting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While climbing Fails and Ed reached the top anchor first, this anchor was shared between two routs
and Murray and Jon were on the other route. While Murray and Jon had set off first, Fails and Ed
had the advantage of one
less pitch. Murray and Jon’s
route finished with a good
jamming crack that would
have been a quality trad lead.
With the French climbers
closing in from the bottom
Murray had to unclip some of
Fail’s quick draws after Fails
was safely on the anchor and
build his own as there was
not enough space on the
existing one. The top out was
covered in choss, some of
which was knocked down by
almost everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the first set of groups
topped out they began their
walk down so that they could
rest and prepare for the next
climb. The second set of
climbers topped out and
descended without trouble.
This left the Choss Master
and the American as the last
group to finish the climb. The
Choss Master had earned his&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;name previously by knocking off vast quantities of choss onto his b-layers all trip, and this climb was
no exception. Using the radios to warn of the large quantities of choss descending the cliff allowed
everyone time to run for cover, after the first load helmets were replaced. During the descent the
two climbers took a wrong turn, after some time the other members became concerned about their
absence. They were on the far side of a ridge, so radio contact was useless. After some time radio
contact was re-established by walking to the top of the ridge and all was well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision was made back at camp to travel back to Font that evening so as to have more
bouldering time. A curry was cooked up by fails and the tent packed in record time and ICMC were
on the road again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="313-day-13--loughborough"&gt;3.13 Day 13 – Loughborough
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arriving at Font very early in the
morning a few hours sleep were
had in the forest again. Another
member of ICMC would be joining
for just the 1 day of climbing;
Justine who lived in Paris got the
train to join us. Numerous
problems were climbed including
one with many monos in it, finding
the monos difficult to hold Murray
climbed it without the m. A slab
next to base camp was found and
it had few holds, a few finger nail
crimps and smears, it was alto
slightly slimy. Attempts were made
by most people who all slid down
its face. Murray used the incredible
friction of his stealth onyx rubber
to climb it using the crimps and
later eliminated these as well
proving once again that 5.10 make
the best rubber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going to a real campsite this time
ICMC met Loughborough university
mountaineering club. It turned out
that they were on their annual trip to font for 10 days. They were all very impressed by our big red
bus and were even more amazed after they found out what we had been doing for the last two
weeks. Some members of Loughborough had slack lines and were very skilled at it, one member
having a 100 m long one at home. The evening was spent sitting around the camp fire exchanging
stories eating chilli with a slightly soapy taste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="314-day-14--blood-sweat-and-washing-up-liquid"&gt;3.14 Day 14 – Blood, Sweat and Washing up Liquid
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having a lazy start to the day everyone stayed in bed for a while before getting up and showering.
While preparing breakfast washing up liquid was found all over one of the boxes and needed
cleaning out, this explained the interesting flavour in the previous nights meal, on the positive side
the cooking box was the cleanest it had been since it was new. The tent was packed up one last time
and farewells were said to the Loughborough climbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Travelling to a different area of Font this day. Jon was feeling very ill so spent most of the day asleep.
A blue circuit was attempted but it was poorly sign posted so was abandoned. Murray found an even
bigger, steeper smoother slab to climb which took him quite a long time to work but he got it in the
end. A large overhanging bulge was found by Fails and Adrian who worked out beta and climbed it,
other members tried and Murray managed it after many goes. While driving back to a different car
park to have dinner Murray had a random nose bleed while driving so pulled over and let Ed finish.
The last supper was carbonara and everyone was full to bursting after eating it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setting off on the drive back to England the decision was made to avoid the toll roads since there
was so much spare time before the train left. Most of the drive back was on minor roads and
through villages, this didn’t have much impact as the speed limits were all 100 kph so the bus was
maxed out anyway. Arriving at the terminal 4 hours early the bus was upgraded for free onto a much
earlier train so that they arrived back into the UK in god time. Arriving at the union shortly after
dawn the bus was unpacked and all the equipment dumped into stores to be sorted at a later date.
Keys, first aid kit and minibus documentation returned to the SAC, all the members went their
separate ways to get a proper sleep in a bed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;10 members of Imperial College Mountaineering Club travelled to the sunny
island of Mallorca from the 12th to the 25th September. Not for the cheap thrills of
Shagaluf but for the vast amounts of climbing on offer. While on tour many
different areas were visited with all sorts of climbing on offer from caves to slabs.
Some members achieved very highly whereas others had a less fortunate time.
The aims and objectives of the tour were for members to climb in a different
environment to those that they are used to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Mallorca the climbing was all sport
or deep water soloing which are less common in the UK. There were also some
longer multi pitch routs that members enjoyed climbing. Due to unforeseen
circumstances 2 members had to use their recently acquired advanced first aid
skills to help one team member out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall Mallorca was an excellent location to visit. There was a wide range of
grades from very easy to very hard. A lot of the very interesting routs were
harder than many members could climb. Despite being a relatively small island
there was a significant amount of driving. We managed to take advantage of
cheap villas due to the off peak season and found some cheap car rental places,
food was also remarkably low cost. We all learnt the hard way that accidents can
happen, even when not doing a particularly difficult climb and we must always
be aware of hazards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Top Row: Ruth, Jon, Ali, Lisa, Ollie, Elliot, Murray. Bottom Row: Tristan, Abi, Fails&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="people"&gt;People
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The people going on the tour were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Matthew Lees (Murray) - President&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mike Jones (Fails) – Vice President&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jonathan Price&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alastair Brash&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lisa Alhadeff&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Elliot Carrington&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tristan Pollitt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ruth Lawson&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Abi Attrell&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oliver Mower&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="diary"&gt;Diary
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id="day-1--flight"&gt;Day 1 – Flight
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;With 10 members flying from all over the country to Palma it was quite
remarkable that all but one person had met in the country just after noon. The
one member who had decided to take a later flight for a sweet deal wouldn’t
arrive until much later that night and cause much unnecessary driving, the fuel
for which probably cancelled out his own saving. Picking up the cars turned out
to be not as simple as expected, the rental firm was too cheap to buy a place in
the airport and needed a bus to get there. The cars however were very cheap
and were already scratched and dented, as a bonus hey came with free
insurance meaning we wouldn’t get fined for bumping the car.
Driving out of Palma proved to be difficult but after a scenic drive around the city
the motorway was found and the other side of the island quickly reached.
Arriving at the accommodation Ali was convinced that the lead diver Murray was
completely lost but was surprised when it turned out that they had arrived at
their accommodation. The villa was perfect for the club needs and was very
cheap. Classic ICMC Chilli was had for dinner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/summer-tour-2011/images/0.jpg" width="300"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="day-2--el-fumat"&gt;Day 2 – El Fumat
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first crag to be visited on the trip was
thought to be a local crag called El Fumat,
but turned out to be the other side of a
mountain so there was some slow uphill
diving. The crag had excellent views and
was well bolted. Most members found the
grades to be hard; this was probably due
to the new location and tiredness. On the
menu for dinner was Curry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="day-3--les-perxes"&gt;Day 3 – Les Perxes
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The area chosen today had a couple of
different crags. Most of the group went to
the easier section near the car park called
Hairpin but Ali and Lisa decided to go for
the cave nearby. The easy crag got sun
around 2 and became too hot for climbing,
the cave being north facing remained cool
all day. Some members decided to go
watch the cave climbing and take photos but others went to the higher crag that
had a little bit more shade.
Ali managed to climb an impressive climb up with some good tufa action and a
nice rest in the middle. One of the local climbers then crushed it while warming
up for a much harder climb. Carbonara was on the table tonight, there was much
debate over what the ingredients should be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/summer-tour-2011/images/1.jpg" width="300"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="day-4--deep-water-solo"&gt;Day 4 – Deep Water Solo
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being the tour’s first venture into DWS an easy small crag was chosen. There
were 3 routs on the smallest section; the 6a was enjoyable and easy and done by
most. The water was very clear and we could easily see that the bottom was
a long way down There was a good 7a with a cool dino in the middle which
many people fell off. Some members quickly decided they didn’t like DWS
and others needed to work on jumping off to get over a fear of height. Some
members had no problem jumping off the cliffs but had some minor issues
entering the water.
At the top of the cliff there was a mast, probably used for sailing the island
to new locations, where we left all of our food and bags. Ali, Ruth and Lisa
managed to hit their heads on the mast; unfortunately since they were not
climbing at this point in time they didn’t have helmets on, all 3 felt very silly.
A DWS dinghy was bought to help get people to the bottom of the climbs
and to rescue them in case something went wrong. Various names were put
forward, there were: Lizzie Wilkins, Fun Splash, Enema, Ella and Emma. After
some debate the name Ella stuck, it was later revealed that this was also the
name of Jacob Dean’s 12 year old sister, after this the innuendos came thick and
fast. Fajitas were for dinner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/summer-tour-2011/images/2.jpg" width="300"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="day-5--rest-day-1"&gt;Day 5 – Rest day 1
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people slept in late this day after some early starts on the previous days.
Everyone except Ali went for a walk along the coast but Ali remained behind to
do a literature review. While walking a large number of naked people were seen,
this was highly disturbing. An old abandoned pill box was found and explored, it
was very hot inside. Finding a small cover everyone sat down and had a lovely
time playing in the water. Murray kicked a rock while swimming and bled all over
the place. Fails annoyed a sea anemone by destroying its home and it got its own
back by stinging Fails, Elliot and Ruth. Since it was Elliot’s last night with us we
had another Chilli to remind him of all the good times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="day-6--sa-gubia-eastern-side"&gt;Day 6 – Sa Gubia, eastern side
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another early start to get to the crag before the sun hit it. The massive walls of
Sa Gubia were on the table for today. Ali and Lisa decided to have a day alone
and headed over to the steep hard world of Fraguel. After quite a long walk in up
a dry river bed the bottom of the wall was reached where we met 2 local
climbers who gave us a lot of tips about which crags not to visit as they had bad
bolts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2 best climbs of the day were
a delicate 6a and an outrageous
6a+ which had some cool tufa
action on it. Ali and Lisa also had a
good day out. The group split in 2
with half heading back to make a
curry for dinner and the others
taking Elliot to the airport for him
to head home early.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="day-7--dws--more-sa-gubia"&gt;Day 7 – DWS &amp;amp; more Sa Gubia
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Murray, Jon, fails, Abi and Ollie
headed over to Cala Sa Nau to try
out a different area. There were a
number of easy climbs, fails
managed a 6b but failed on the
7a. Murray tried the 7a from day 4
but ripped the tip of his finer off
on the sloping crimp. Abi jumped
off the top and made a big splash.
Ella was launched; she was a
much finer vessel than the other group who were at the crag.
The climbers at Sa Gubia tried a number of different things. Tristan and Ruth had
a mini adventure on their 2 pitch multi pitch. Ali and Lisa tried a few hard things
with little success. Since it was a Sunday most shops were closed so there was
not a lot of food to be had. Heavy rain made the road outside the apartments
turn into a small river. Since it was Lisa’s last day she decided to get drunk
instead of packing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="day-8--rest-day-2"&gt;Day 8 – Rest Day 2
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ali got up early to take Lisa to the airport, everyone else stayed in bed for quite a
while. While Ali was sleeping most other people went for a large food shop taking
advantage of Lidl’s cheap prices. After the shop everyone moved to the beach to
enjoy the Mallorca sun. The slack line was put up and everyone had a good go
with various levels of susses, this attracted many tourists who took&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;photos, if a hat had been left out we probably would have made some money.
Towards the end of the day we moved the slack line to two trees that were much
further apart, right at the limit of how far the slack line could reach. While
tensioning the line we melted a section as there was so much force! This line was
very long and wobbled a lot. Murray and Tristan both got about half way on it but
nobody made it the whole length. Some people were scared off by the height of
the line but the soft sand gave a good landing and when it sagged in the middle
it was quite close to the floor anyway. While slack lining Fails failed and landed
with one leg either side of the line and had to sit down for a while, see right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/summer-tour-2011/images/3.jpg" width="300"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/summer-tour-2011/images/4.jpg" width="300"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="day-9--the-accident"&gt;Day 9 – The Accident
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ali and Fails headed off to a hard over hanging crag with short boulder like routs.
Everyone else went to Puig St Martin where there was shade all day and easy
climbs. A number of different routes were done. While trying a 5+ with a high first bolt Ollie slipped and hit the ground. He had broken his ankle and mountain
rescue were called to evacuate him. Jon and Murray had both been on the union
run outdoor first aid course which proved very useful. Both tried to check for
broken bones but didn’t feel anything that felt broken, both were carrying first
aid kits but there was little they could do. Four firemen arrived with a stretcher to
carry him out, they were not particularly gentle. Everyone went to visit Ollie that
evening, he was on pain killers at this point and seemed quite merry, fortunately
he had BMC insurance and everything was OK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="day-10--dws"&gt;Day 10 – DWS
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abi decided that she wanted to stay with Ollie for the day and keep him company
as being in a foreign hospital. Everyone else decided to go deep water soloing as
there would be nothing to hit and get hurt on. Ali and Fails went to Cala Barques
and everyone else went to Santanyi. Ali and Fails found their perfect climbs of
steep jug climbing with big powerful moves. The others enjoyed their day and
went to visit the legendary Es Pontas and were surprised by how shallow the
water was there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="day-11--les-perxes-mark-ii"&gt;Day 11 – Les Perxes Mark II
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A permanent problem with Mallorca was trying to find shady crags where the
heat was not too severe. Port Soller had a large amount of shade but we
discovered building works and so couldn’t climb there. Returning to a previously
visit crag is generally avoided on tour but this area has several sections. Ali and
Fails went to the cave and tried more hard things. Everyone else went to the
upper section called Muro de Caimari. There were several hard climbs done by
all. Ruth and Tristan found an extremely pumpy 6b which was very hard. Ollie
was visited in the evening and this time had a large amount of metal in his leg
after the operation and was in for a bad night sleep. After climbing we took Fails
to the airport as he had found a sweet deal and booked an earlier flight home&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="day-12--betlem"&gt;Day 12 – Betlem
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Waking to the sound of heavy rain was not a good start to the day. Almost all the
climbing locations would be soaked and the only things able to be climbed would
be caves. Contrary to the malicious propaganda spread by the Outdoor Club we
did not go to a pub, we went climbing instead. A crag called El Calo de Betlem
was decided upon as it had some shelter and easy cave climbs. Arriving at the
crag to find that rock fax lied and only a part of the routes were dry we soldiered
on. Most people tried a cool looking 6b which had some hard moves in it to a
hidden and now sodden slot. While Abi was on top rope an assisted dyno was
attempted with no result. Another nearby area was investigated but the best
routs were slabs that were still wet and there were serious signs of seepage.
Murray and Ruth checked out an abandoned house which had an aloe vera plant
in front that was about 3m tall and you could stand on its branches/leaves.
Setting up a water line over the pool was discussed at length. We found 2 points
that we felt would be suitable anchors and active spotting near the edges of the
pool was also proposed. Unfortunately it was felt that the 2 anchors were too far apart and a water line was not put up. Instead a raft was built from the many
empty water bottles with an impressively poor result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="day-13--home-time"&gt;Day 13 – Home Time
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ali and Abi went back to Les Perxes for Ali to try and finish his route. The top slab
was wet and no route finishing happened. Packing the cars with all of our stuff
took a while and lead to a rather uncomfortable trip to the airport. Both cars had
to be returned empty and so the economy race was on. Murrays diesel had only
had 1 ½ tanks of fuel so was already low but made it to the rental drop of shortly
after the fuel light came on. Ali was forced to put in an extra 5 euros of fuel. At
the airport there was a slight challenge convincing the staff that Ollie couldn’t
walk and that he needed a wheel chair. After a large amount of repacking to get
everyone under the weight limit we all ate and drank as much as we could to get
as heavy as possible to reduce the fuel economy of the plane to restore Ryanair’s
karma. Arriving late at Stansted we were all greeted by an enormous line for
border control with some grumpy staff who were extremely unhelpful. We retried
our bags and then all went our separate ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-1"&gt;Day 1
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the 10 tour members departing from different airports throughout the country everyone
arrived in Alicante Airport, Spain at roughly the same time (varying between 09:30am and 11am
local time). The first port of call was the car rental station where two hire cars were collected. One
being upgraded two stages for free because they didn&amp;rsquo;t have the booked car, thus providing us with
a 7-seater, dubbed the &amp;ldquo;win-car&amp;rdquo; for the rest of the tour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A (theoretical) hour later with some exploration of the Spanish coast led to everyone arriving in the
first villa of the stay, graciously provided by Joergen. Unloading and lunch ensued then reloading
into the cars and off to the beach to find one of the deep-water-soloing crags mentioned in the
guide-books. After some non-existent right-turns eventually an alternative was found and the fun
began.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For many of our members this was the first time they had been deep-water-soloing, climbing
without ropes above the sea, the day ended with a spot of tombstoning from the top of the cliff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-2"&gt;Day 2
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We traveled the short journey down the coast to Sierra de Toix to climb at a place called Toix TV.
After spending thirty minutes driving around the maze of holiday homes, we finally reached the crag
as it began to pour with rain. Climbing began, regardless, with several routes being lead including a
7a (very hard!) lead by Joergen. After this, Tom set off on a route –accessed via a dodgy rope bridge -
but ended up climbing past the lower-off, resulting in a run out traverse and a scramble to safety!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-3"&gt;Day 3
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We set off to Forrada in search of some quality climbing. Four hours later, after driving through
continuous hairpins, we reached a track described in the guide book as “rough in places”. This was
discovered to be something of an understatement!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The climbing at Forrada was fantastic and turned out to be well worth the journey. At least it was
until the monsoon arrived and forced us to shelter in a cave for the next hour, waiting for the rock to
dry. The heavy downpour turned out to be a daily occurrence and always coincided with Brigette
being stranded halfway up a lead. Joergen and Jacob managed to find some more difficult climbing
in an area sheltered from the storm. One particular route (Starman, 7a+) provided them with
conversation for the rest of the week. The journey back to the villa that evening was considerably
shorter due to the saturated soil which allowed us to ‘mud-plane’ back down the track from the
crag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-4"&gt;Day 4
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/summer-tour-2009/images/1.jpg" width="300"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We headed back to the Sierra de Toix region but this time to Toix Ouest. Once again it rained in the
afternoon (there is a theme here) so we went back to the villa for lunch. The plan for the afternoon
was to head a short distance from the villa to Echo Valley. Unfortunately we got lost and drove half
an hour into the valleys, ending up at a place that wasn’t in the guide book but did come
recommended by a woman in stripy yellow trousers (clearly a climber). The boulderers among the
group made friends with a local man-of -the-crag who showed them the best traverse in the area
whilst chain smoking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-5"&gt;Day 5
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the antics of the previous three days, it was decided we should take a rest day. We had a lazy
morning by the pool followed by some deep water soloing in the afternoon. It was warmer in the sea
than out, so we swam about before coming home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/summer-tour-2009/images/2.jpg" width="300"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/summer-tour-2009/images/3.jpg" width="300"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-6"&gt;Day 6
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was our first trip to Sella (the biggest crag in the area) and we were not disappointed. The
routes were amazing. Tom and Brigette started a multipitch but true to form, when Brigette’s
involved, it began to rain as soon as they had both reached the first belay. After much commotion
and a variety of problems, they both abseiled down to safety. Meanwhile, diehard boulderer, Jacob
gets his head for heights as he takes his first fall whilst leading (after much bullying from Alistair and
Joergen).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fresher took a less active approach to the day and made a hammock at the base of the crag. His
creativity got the better of him later in the day when he attempted to make a zip line into the
swimming pool back at the villa. Fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-7"&gt;Day 7
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We went to Echo Playa and for the first time since the first day, the sun was out. Quickly, we realized
that it was too hot and hoped for mild temperatures once again!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of us went off to do ‘traditional’ climbing, whilst the others climbed sport routes. By lunch
time everyone was far too hot, so we decided to go back to the villa for a siesta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the afternoon, Fresher had a brilliant idea: He built a raft from water bottles and set sail in the
swimming pool. However, his success was short lived as Tom and Jacob bombed him, sinking his
raft!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That night, we moved to a villa in the mountains. Whilst everyone was packing, Fresher managed to
put a large dent in the car. However, he did fix it with his trusty plunger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-8"&gt;Day 8
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jacob, Alistair and Joergen climbed a three pitch route. Joergen, however, left his shoes at home, so
they ended up sharing two pairs between three people, swapping shoes for each pitch. In the
meantime, Charlene and Simon completed their first lead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/summer-tour-2009/images/4.jpg" width="300"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That evening ICMC stormed Benidom! We saw the delights that were on offer, Sticky Vicki, The
Mediteraneun Bar to name but two&amp;hellip; We opted for the beach. Simon and the girls somehow ended
up in the sea, partly clothed and Fresher got buried. ICMC returned home, distinctly weter and
sandier than before and settled down for a nice bowl of carrot curry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/summer-tour-2009/images/5.jpg" width="300"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/summer-tour-2009/images/6.jpg" width="300"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-9"&gt;Day 9
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back to Sierra de Toix again! Spurred on by the previous days multipitch, Fresher, Simon and Brigette
set off on a three pitch excursion. Charlene climbed a route with a rope that was too short to be
lowered off, so had to do some imaginative maneuvers to get down!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By this stage everyone else was bored with Toix and decided to do some more deep-water-soloing,
leaving Fresher and co halfway up their multipitch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-10"&gt;Day 10
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was our last full day of climbing, so we decided to go back to Sella as it was so good before. Tom
and Ed managed to complete the multipitch that they got rained off last time. Charlene and Simon
continued to tick off a number of lead climbs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During late afternoon, there was a massive downpour which resulted in half the group running for
cover and leaving everyone else to pack up all the gear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-11"&gt;Day 11
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last day! The weather was worse than ever, it was raining when we woke up! We packed and
cleaned the house before driving towards Alicante. When we got there it was far too wet to sit on
the beach, so what would a group of university students do in Alicante for a day? Obviously we
found the nearest Toys ’R’Us and set about trying to play with every toy in the shop!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the tour went very well. I would not have made any fundamental changes to the way
it ran, things that could be improved in the future are small organizational things such as being
better at buying the correct amount of food for a large number of people. Financially, the tour broke
even. And a good time was had by all! The only thing that did not go as planned was the fact that it
rained so often! But that being said, we went climbing every day and still had an amazing time.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>ICMC Journal 1997</title><link>YAYAYA/p/icmc-journal-1997/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 1997 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>YAYAYA/p/icmc-journal-1997/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;By the editor, Rich Marshall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id="editorial-i-made-this"&gt;Editorial: I MADE THIS
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As far as I can deduce this happens to be only the third journal in 29 years, the last being printed
in 1974! Amazingly this relic from the past contains stories the traditional last meet of the first tern
(Bosigran!), the dinner meet, an expedition in the Bolivian Andes (with 23 routes climbed, some
potentially 15
ascents!) and talks by Doug Scott (I&amp;quot; ascent of Everest&amp;rsquo;s north face!) Has the club changed
over the years, I ask myself? Well to be honest, NO. There are enough of stories of stopping for &amp;ldquo;spew
stops&amp;rdquo; and disappearing off to far flung corners of the globe with union money only to end up drinking
and pulling to realise we&amp;rsquo;re probably doing them proud! May it continue!&lt;/p&gt;

hard work has been reflected through the success of the club, well done. Secondly thanks to Megan who:
bright smile followed by swift punch in the groin has &amp;ldquo;encouraged&amp;rdquo; many people to contribute! Alsc
thanks to Rich Marr who sorted out all the pictures, aren&amp;rsquo;t they cool! A short note of thanks to my

&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It all started one afternoon above a betting shop on Fulham Road. A collection of alcoholics
watching an evening of British cinema including The Italian Job&amp;rsquo; and Monty
Python&amp;rsquo;s .and now for something completely different. This unbounded of
Stupidity was to set the atmosphere for the entire holidav.
A Taxi ride at breakneck
speed in the wee small hours took us to Gatwick airport. where the more enthusiastic
of us raced in luggage trolleys across the deserted terminal.
A plane and a train later we found ourselves in El Chorro (the centre of
nownere) onlv to tind an automobile driver
I by
our gracious host, and rally-driver wannabie
Jean, ready to take us further away tron
anvwhere. The climbing started immediately (although some more
relaxed members of the club decided that they wanted to acclimatise
to the nice weather betore doing anything too strenuous, 1e
sunbathing). El Chorro is a small town on the train line between
Malaga and Seville and is a popular venue for climbers from all
around Europe. The gorge (through which the train line winds its
way) provides varied routes of all grades for beginners and hard-core
climbers alike. with routes anvwhere from 20ft to 400ft in length. In
addition to climbing, the surrounding hills are excellent for mountain
biking.
A 70 vear old steel cable, stretchina diagonallv across the
gorge provided entertainment and photo opportunities as thre
members of the club travelled across (at this point please bear in
mind that the cable is over 100m above a white-water river and is 150m long). Surprisingly enough there were no serious casualties during the trip, (and all of the minor
injuries seemed to be focused on James a rock fell on me&amp;rsquo; Philips). Our honoured treasurer did some
rather impressive shit, and we all cheered. He also fell off, and we cheered again and threw beans at him
Arguably the most epic climb of the trip was a route named El Amptrax, graded French 6a (where 8c is
about the hardest climbable). Amptrax was a route that went up the highest part of the rock and took the
entire day for two pairs of climbers to complete, and included a dramatic overhang on the final pitch
Not all Of our time was spent being macho, tanned, hard-bodj
types. We also spent some time walking in the hills absorbing the beautifu
scenery (yean right), as well as swimming naked in the reservoir just north
of the upper gorge (no seriously we did, apart form the naked bit, I lied
about that) / and the bar, Ed. J. At this point I would like to say that Belay
bunny only had chips (SOrry a personal joke, It&amp;rsquo;s very tunny, trust me). Al
the end or the week we were loath to leave, but with shortening tunas and
looming exams we returned home, with improved personal bests and some nice tans.&lt;/p&gt;

Clear sunny day. Vur chance had come to do a route on the Aiguille de I&amp;rsquo;M. My climbing partner, Ben and I set off early from the campsite to catch the cable car from the town at 7am to reach the Plan du
&amp;lsquo;Aiguille. We had decided to do a relatively low route (a maximum altitude of 2844m) to avoid the snow
that had built up, but there was still up to a foot of snow on the lower slopes.
We trekked for two hours across small snowfields and glacial moraine. The route we had planned
to do had a bit of snow and ice on it and looked very bad. We had crampons and ice axes with us, but w
decided to do an easier route which Should be in better condition with more sun facing it. After another
trek we finally began climbing the NNE ridge of the M. The route was better, but still had snow coverer
ledges, and climbing in rock shoes made getting over these difficult. A couple of other climbers started to
follow us up, and they turned out to be British.
The first pitches of the climb were alright, but they began to get harder. We soon reached a large
ledge which had lots of snow on it, and I got my feet cold and wet. The next pitch was a small chimner
but it had ice on the inside, which made it difficult to gel
up. Ben lead the ditch and I managed to scramble un it

clouds had come in and it was starting to snow. It was
also getting late and we were in danger of missing the
last cable car down. Finally we reached the top and coulc

we couldn&amp;rsquo;t find the route off the top, as there was so much snow, and it looked too dangerous to try
We were soon joined by the other climbers, Roger and Michelle (trom Barnsley), who were alsc
very tired and unsure of the &amp;lsquo;walk out&amp;rsquo; route. Ben and I decided to abseil off the way we had climbed up, as
at least we knew the way. The chance of us catching the cable car was now very slim. We had onlv:
single 50m rope with us so it would take several abseils to get down. We had to leave bits of sling and
cord behind tied around spikes to thread the rope through. We saw the others following us down, but they
were using two 50m ropes tied together.
We reached the large ledge about a third of the way down, when we heard shouts from above. We
stopped and looked up to see Michelle shouting down to us that they had got their ropes jammed,

Michelle was waiting. They managed to absell and scramble down to where we were waiting. They only
had two pieces of rope left, about one third of their original length.
It was starting to get dark now, and was still snowing. The four of us abseiled down our rope off
the rest of the mountain. By the time we reached the base, it was black and we had missed the cable car
down by hours. There was nothing for it but to walk down to the valley, 1500m below us.
We only had a few torches with us, and the ground was very difficult with snow to start with
leading onto the glacial moraine, large lumps of granite which are hard to cross. After several hours wt
managed to find a path which eventually led to a track through the forest. We were all extremely
exhausted and stumbling along these rough tracks, often tripping up over rocks and roots. Our torch
batteries were beginning to fade. We kept on going, even though I was tempted just to find a nice bush
and go to sleep under it. We could see the town lights, but they never seemed to get closer. At 2am We
finally reached the campsite and just flopped into bed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="ireland-sea-stacks-dont-jump"&gt;Ireland: sea stacks, don&amp;rsquo;t jump
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having conquered the Alps a couple of weeks previously, the
Spacevan then travelled off to SW Ireland with Graham and I in it. Having
bored the f*ck out of Graham looking for my ancestral home in Cork, we
finally managed to climb a handful of stunning pitches near Killarney in Cr
Kerrv. Even though this part holds the highest mountain in Ireland
(Carrantouhill), the amount of rock climbing is quite limited compared to the
northern and eastern areas (e.g. Wicklow) - which I encourage vou to visit in
the not too distant titure
The highlight of the trip was when Graham almost killed himself
jumping 18m off a sea stack. Soloing up the 30m high stack (about V Diff
was nevertless superb. However, one morning whilst culturing around
Dingle in Kerry, I discovered the true magic of freshly made Irish Soda
Bread.
I have recently discovered a scientific explanation for this magic - it 1:
in the acidity of the buttermilk which reacts with the alkalinity of the soda
making it rise even better! Grabam was not impressed - luckily he didn&amp;rsquo;t have
to suffer this decadence as he had remembered to bring his own strange
variety of bread all the way from the co-op in Devon&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="postcard-from-lyon-graham-cooper-on-tour"&gt;Postcard from Lyon: Graham Cooper on Tour
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Club,
being a keen student, I naturally took the opportunity of spending a year in France at a college in Lyon as
to broaden my horizons and learn the French way of engineering. It had nothing to do witl
the close proximity of the Alps and endless possibilities of routes on rock, snow and ice to explore.
The mountaineering club in Lyon are a good crowd who I met at the year&amp;rsquo;s hirst p&lt;em&gt;ss up, and who
then decided it would be a laugh to invite some English p&lt;/em&gt;sshead, to do some climbing with them. The
year started well with a few easy warm up peaks ( Pic de l&amp;rsquo;tendard, and the Alberon) which gave me
chance to overcome some quite important communication difficulties. These routes were simple glacie:
walks although a little steep in places for the Alberon. After that, before it got too cold we did one
weekend of big rock routes in the Erins massif. this was one of the best weekends I&amp;rsquo;ve had this year and
we did one route high up graded D, and one route the next day of 350m at a level around 6a, quoter
ID/ID+. You hardcore nutter. Ed. I
Unfortunately after that there were lots of parties so I stayed in Lyon. (Two coachloads of

Delore Christmas however, I did manage to spend 5 davs near Chamonix (Cluses&amp;rsquo;
doing some big rock routes (not too high up because it was cold) and a weekend in the Calanques (set
cliffs near Marseilles: reminded me of Devon)
After Christmas the ice chimbing season begins. We are but mortal men, so interspersed with
some climbing a group of us had a go at that to. By halt term we were getting quite reasonable and hadn'1
yet had any fatal injuries, but then one dark night while descending I tripped over and cut my finger. Fully
recovered by half term I did a bit more including Chere Couloir on Mont Blanc du Tacul. /A route I car
personally recommend, Ed./ Finally on the last day I did my first bit of vertical ice which was a cigar of
about 10 meters followed by other smaller vertical passages. [NICE, Ed.] After that all the ice falls fell
down, sometimes with people on them, so we stopped climbing them.
Since half term I&amp;rsquo;ve done a few other things, some skung and ski trekking but what I really want
to do is an approach on skis, then an iced up gully then decent on skis, but the weather hasn&amp;rsquo;t beer
so that will have to walt.
That&amp;rsquo;s about all. I hope you&amp;rsquo;ve had a cool year, and if any one wants to come out to the Alps al
Easter or in the summer, I shall be there all the time. Hope you have a good dinner meet, (worms aren&amp;rsquo;t
good for you).

&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apparently, it&amp;rsquo;s traditional to go to Cornwall for the last trip of the Winter term - and as far as
I&amp;rsquo;m concerned it&amp;rsquo;s a bloody good one! The trip started with having our normal early hours arrival at thr
Count House which was complete with regimented lines of drawing pins, and more rules than a nunnery.
We emerged from our sleeping bags, later that morning (about 4 hours later to be precise) only tc
realise that we had picked the one weekend in the entire Cornish winter that had seen any sun! The
weather outside even managed to motivate Garth to emerge from his bag with less than the customar:
seven thousand curses, insults and threats of death. After a breaktast of porridge/concrete (no one was toc
sure) which really hit the spot (in the bin we were prepared for the long walk into the crag.
Hive ministe
later we were basking in the morning sun and several members of the club wel
re contemplauna takinc
there trousers off (well Rob had seen some prime lamb).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A day of decadent climbing followed, with Megan and Ruth forming the women&amp;rsquo;s liberation
front climbing corps and deciding that all men were bastards on the way up Door-post /I told you not t
let them out of the kitchen, Ed. J. The old school boys managed to find a few routes that they hadn&amp;rsquo;t done
at least twenty times before, while everyone else sampled all the treats Bosigran had in store. Rob jogger
up Anvil Chorus and hauled James P up the last pitch atter him he then announced that VSs were going
OK
so he&amp;rsquo;d try an El (Suicide Wall)
While Rob and Al started Suicide Wall, Ian and myself decided to do
the awesome Anvil chorus - the first pitches were pure climbing pleasure anc
then we got to the infamous layback crack. It was all going fine and I was
about 2/3rds of the way up the crack when I saw the top and went for It. A
purely instinctive reaction, two layback moves (now with a left leg thal
wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have been out of place in an Elvis dance routine) later and I was
covering some serious air miles.. One of my bits of gear decided that it didn&amp;quot;
particularly like being in the rock, in fact it didn&amp;rsquo;t even like being on the rope
and duly detached itself from it, the second held and I bounced on the rope
about and inch or two below the belay ledge
Remarkably lan managed to sustain the worst injury (I was fine) with
a nice little burn mark across his belaying hand (cheers lan). After
establishing that my left leg was now having problems sticking to the ground, let alone the rock (due to
unwanted vibrations that a Union van would be proud of), I decided to ab. down later to get my bit of gear
out. I spent the rest of the day trying to find my bit of projectile gear and seconding up a lovely slab routt
with Al.
While James &amp;ldquo;Nice C and his sous-chet Ruth, worked their magic with a saucepan, we all
buggered off down the pub&amp;hellip; on return we discovered a meal fit for a King, in fact about 500 kings, and
we all tucked in. A night of drinking, smoking and pulling ourselves along the floor with some
professional climbers ensued. followed by another cats chorus (which I&amp;rsquo;m sure the other inhabitants of the
hut appreciated).
The next day was spent in pretty much the same fashion as the first, with me getting my
confidence back and everyone else basking in the second day of lovely sun. We prepared to leave with a
great deal of reluctance, Megan providing entertainment for Sam and Garth - Sam attempting to drown
her in the shower and Gareth performing the first steps of some bizarre mating ritual by wiping a dirty T
towel in
her face (whatever turns you on &amp;rsquo;ehh Megan!). James and Al. sped off in the space-mobile (mark
I while the rest of us chugged back in the van&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last weekend ICMC embarked on their second trip of the year to North Wales. Although just
before the trip the thought of spending two grim days in what I expected to be a very wet and cold Wales
didn&amp;rsquo;t fill me with joy, it turned out to be on of the best weekends ever
We didn&amp;rsquo;t get the weekend off to a great start with most of Friday evening spent waiting for the
AA in our traditional stop at Lutterworth. We were at least kept entertained by watching the locals
smashing
up cars and trying to kill each other, a typical notherners Friday night entertainment
After arriving at the hut fairly late we got off to a typical start, 1.. slept in till the afternoor
When we did get up we went off to the pass and did some great routes, with Simon coming close tr
getting a few more Air Miles (as if he doesn&amp;rsquo;t have enough already). The general feature of most of the
routes was mud and cr*p, inspiring Sam to do a new route and naming it &amp;ldquo;Sam&amp;rsquo;s grassy plateau&amp;rdquo;, nc
Drizes for
guessing what that consisted of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later it was back to the hut to consume a fantastic meal prepared by James Carter along with vas
amounts of beer/What even you? Ed]. The rest of the evening was
spent planning how best to use the spare keys to S&amp;amp;G&amp;rsquo;s minibus
which we had somehow acquired! Suggestions included ram
raiding the Snowden Honey farm, unfortunately everyone was ta:
to sone to carry anv or them our
Sunday we split up, half climb in Treamadog and the rest
go up to Snowden via the Crib Goch ridge with continuos sunshine
ensuring both parties enjoyed themselves. The day ended with a
complete tour of London on the way back as Dan tried to remembe
exactly where he lived, pronouncing
&amp;ldquo;I must live near Wembley, I
can see the stadium from my house&amp;rdquo; to much hilarity from withir
the bus!&lt;/p&gt;

underway with organising the kitchen whilst the Gear (Alan) organises the gear! All the other S&amp;amp;Gites
loaf about getting in the way with one exception, Hideous Buggar, who manages to do it with such
professionalism others start to question his parentage
An earlv start (up at 6:30! was folled by the weather dumping several inches of snow on the roac

Cairngorm car park and trekking in the conditions were found to be excellent leading to many ascenti
over the next few days. These included The Runnel (RH variation), Aladdin&amp;rsquo;s Couloir, Red Gully, Fiacle
Ridge, Broken Gully and Jacobs ladder. The hardest route of the week, Invernookie (LIL/IV) was
completed by the mountaineers, Of course.
Chosen because the guide book describes it as a route that changes little with conditions. A
phrase I now consider to be the biggest lie I&amp;rsquo;ve ever heard, including the excuses for not writing articles!
The first pitch (out of condition) consisted of using 3 lumps of turf to climb 20m of iceless slab.
second pitch (out of condition), lead by Julian consisted of levitating up s &amp;ldquo;powder&amp;rsquo;
steps without
knocking them down on me. The third pitch (out of condition) should have been a near vertical pitch in
kind of broken chimney, ho ho ho what a joke. Instead it involved hooking iceaxes on overhanging rocks
to the left whilst using ice smears for your feet, a technique I learnt very quickly! This was followed by :
small powder filled offwidth with an overhanging wall to the left trine to push vou onto a totally blant
face on the right. How we laughed. tears in our eves. The pitch can only be best characterised by the amount of swearing Julian managed in one breath along with the number of times he forcefully suggestec
I was a f*cking psycho.
The only comfort from this was a sudden heat wave ensured no more routes could be done,
topping the last one would be tricky! This meant the last few days merged into a series of distillery trip:

&lt;h3 id="cornwall-2-98-nice"&gt;Cornwall 2 &amp;lsquo;98: NICE
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a pretty cool weekend - on arriving at 2 in the morning we camped next to the &amp;ldquo;No
Camping&amp;rdquo; sign in the Chair ladder car park we couldn&amp;rsquo;t be arsed to find anywhere else! After discovering
that most of the tents had certain essential bits missing, we managed to erect some vaguely tent like tents
and collapse into them only to be evicted in the morning by a pointy head with a dog which wanted to get
into James bivvy bag with him! However it did get going nice and early, we were climbing at Sennen by
about 9.30!
Sennen was pretty nifty, the routes are quite hard and exposed for their grade. I did two HSs, on
the first I had to place a bit of pro whilst using an undercut to reach over an overhang (then proceed lc
pull over the overhang!!). On the second I had to swing out onto a large flake, hand traverse along it with
smears for feet and then mantle shelf onto it - with no hand holds to pull on. Phoar, can 1 have your
children? Ed. / It was excellent! I think I might go back in the summer cause it would be gorgeous
without a force 10 gale!! We managed to find a valid campsite after climbing, despite James&amp;rsquo; cained
protestations that we should go to St Ives &amp;ldquo;cause it was NICE&amp;rdquo;!! The site owner however was a old pointy
headed female with the site itself not being much better. Since all the proper sites were shut however it
was a pretty good, cheap place to camp, with a dub up the road.
Sunday we went to Bosigran and while Daffy launched up Door post I sat about getting rained or
by intermittent showers contemplating whether I could be arsed to climb a very slimy Ding. I decided I
couldn&amp;rsquo;t and went for a hard core bimble (hard core since I was carving a 30-40 pound sack!!)/No excuse
join S&amp;amp;G, Ed.I. Of course this was the cue for the sun to arrive for the rest of the day, so when I found a
nice secluded beach in the blazing sun I couldn&amp;rsquo;t resist a quick dip. This, of course, caused the entire bas
to suddenly be filled with parents and small children leaving me to run back to my bag (half way up the
beach) in my wet boxers in front of a crowd Wembley would be proud of!! The others, by all accounts
went bouldering in a cove round the corner. After that Alex did his Nigel Mansell impression and drove
all the way back - getting us back before midnight&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="swanny-98-13th-15th-feb-nice"&gt;Swanny &amp;lsquo;98 (13th-15th feb): NICE
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;By far and away one of the best weekends despite a rather low turnout. Upon arriving in Lanator
Matravers, we headed for a rendezvous with Sam in The King&amp;rsquo;s Arms. This turned out to be a counle o
barrels of ale in someone&amp;rsquo;s living room, and we almost apologised for bursting into the landlord&amp;rsquo;s home
before we realised it was the local pub. Our local guide arrived before closing time with the news that Old
Tom&amp;rsquo;s Field was closed, so we set up for the night in Young Sam&amp;rsquo;s Lounge. This is a highly recommender
camp site, but watch out for Sam&amp;rsquo;s chocolate logs. Many thanks to the wardens for the use of their well
mamtamned faculties.
The following morning we took the ferry across to Swanage, a surreal experience in the dense
morning fog and eerily silent and calm waters. After breakfast at Ricky&amp;rsquo;s we checked out the local
shop and agreed to meet back at the bus. As per tradition, we lost Al K and almost left him behind. We
chose to go for the climbs at Winspit because they offered a good range of climbs in some fabulou:
surroundings. Al P and I decided to try a well polished HVS 5b ammonite but by the end of the day it had
managed to defeat all of us. Meanwhile Daffy tackled an excellent VS and Ruth, Sam and Al P had a go at
some bolted E&amp;rsquo;s (blot wendies, Ed.] which were far too exciting. Cursing the bad design of ancient sea
creatures, Al P and I went to try the trad routes by the sea but found them to be a bit wet (and there was :
lot of water too). We returned to the Juarrvman&amp;rsquo;s Wall to nav on the bolted routes instead. At the end of
the day Daffy lobbed fantastically on an HVS he was trying to lead, and Ruth and Al P found a trad route
in the quarry that wasn&amp;rsquo;t apparently in the guide book, and promptly named it Lard Arse.
As the night drew in we decided to head back into Swanage to find a pub. We encountered some
particularly odd locais in The Anchor (even odder than us), and decided to hide from them in the back oi
the pub. However they
probably thought Ruth was pretty odd [and who wouldn&amp;rsquo;t, Ed.] when they heard
her announce that she &amp;ldquo;alwavs noticed when it was in front of her. but didn&amp;rsquo;t notice it from behind&amp;rdquo; and
that &amp;ldquo;doing it forwards is much worse that doing it backwards&amp;rdquo; - abselling of course. We decided to cros:
quickly over to The Swan where we dined and danced the night away to the live music from the rocking
and totally un-valentines band. Finally we staggered back up the hill to camp out under the glittering stars
and sweeping bear of the lighthouse&amp;hellip; or on a log if Daffy had anything to do with putting up the tent!
The next morning we arrived at the country park before the crack of dawn (So that&amp;rsquo;ll be Llish
then? Ed.J. As the sun rose we knew we were in for a fabulous day at the Subluminal cliffs. Al K
promptly established our presence at the cliffs by setting up the &amp;ldquo;Abseil Rope Of Doom&amp;rdquo; just east of the
popular Balcony route. A number of friendly climbers who politely asked to make use of the rope were
seen to struggle back up over the edge of the cliff a few hours later, in an obviously less friendly mood.
The bottom of the abseil involved a lovely near-inverted, &amp;ldquo;don&amp;rsquo;t wanna break my skull&amp;rsquo;, free-fall finish fo
added amusement factor - thanks Al. This provided excellent practice for those in the group (previously)
not keen on the activity, and prepped us for some excellent climbs on possibly the best coastal crags in the
country. The easier severe route Gangway provided valuable trad gear leading experience for both Daffy
and myself. Later in the day we were joined by other members of ICMC. James took Megan on the climbs
near face, and lan et al. disappeared to look for some nice hard routes /located in the pub perchance:
Ed.J. Ruth, Daffy and Al P tried a mixed up combination of Highstreet and Bypass, and later Megan made
a leisurely lead up the Highstreet (trust a woman to spend ages on the highstreet). When Al K and I got
rudely blocked off an HS route by some other climbers we decided to take a break, but Daffy and Al F
carried on by tackling first Corner. As the day came to its inevitable but unnecessary end, Ruth finishec
off by leading Damo up Curving Crack and after Al K finished his billionth cigry and went to rescue the
infamous ab rope. Of course, he managed to make another spectacular cock-up of the entire operation anc
almost ended up taking a swim (sorry Al but it&amp;rsquo;s true)! He forgot his prusick (essential for ascending), anc
we suspect he used fart power from the previous night&amp;rsquo;s Skull-ache bitter to get back un. Overall an
entertaining day to round off a perfect trip.
Many thanks to Al P for his excellent driving through the fog-scaped nights and WOCdt Woody for organising the trip (And the Banana Joke).
