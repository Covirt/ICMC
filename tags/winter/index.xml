&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In direct contrast to the South-East of England, Scotland is a rugged and geologically varied country
and plays host to some of the oldest mountains in the world. With such an expansive mountainous
environment, some of the most pivotal figures in British mountaineering history have been Scots, such
as Harold Raeburn and Sir Hugh Munro (the namesake of Scottish peaks exceeding 3,000 feet).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scotland’s proximity to maritime and continental polar weather fronts increases the incidence of
colder weather and snowfall, with the mountainous regions such as the Cairngorms and Grampian
mountains receiving the most, this leads to consistent wintery conditions on the high mountains of
Scotland. As such, technical winter climbing utilizing crampons, ice axes, and traditional climbing
methods is a common seasonal activity drawing people from across the UK and Europe. Recreational
Scottish winter climbing goes
back as far as the 1870s with the
first ascents of the major gullies
on the North face of Ben Nevis,
however, it would be another
two decades until the first
documented ascent of the ultra-
classic Tower Ridge (IV,3) in 1894.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to the
Grampians, the northern
Cairngorms were delayed in
their recreational exploration
with significant development
only occurring after the turn of
the century. Despite this, the
audacity of the climbers and
(fortunately) success only
accelerated, outpacing the
development of mountaineering
equipment, achieving impressive
first ascents such as Point Five
Gully (V, 5) and Orion Face Direct
(V, 5), both of which are
challenging climbs by modern
standards, one can only think of
the harrowing experience and
grave risks that the early
mountaineers exposed
themselves to. The year 1970
brought about massive
change, with the visit of
legendary American rock
climber Yvon Chouinard bringing the first curved ice axes to the UK, and with their arrival, the limits
were further pushed, and the sport further increased in popularity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the development of the sport throughout the 70s and 80s, the state of the sport started to look
more and more like the predecessor to modern winter climbing. With the increased accessibility to,
and media surrounding modern high-altitude mountaineering, mountaineering, alpinism, and winter
climbing have become more popular than ever, with the mountains of Scotland serving as a valuable
training ground for young, up-and-coming alpinists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imperial College Mountaineering Club holds a winter climbing meet in the Cairngorms every year, with
such skills and experience gained serving as the steppingstones for members to conquer greater
objectives, such as student-run expeditions to Alaska’s Alaska Range, and the Monte Rossa Massif in
recent years. This trip aims to continue this long history of developing mountaineering skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="itinerary"&gt;Itinerary
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id="day-1---fireside-tales-2812"&gt;Day 1 - Fireside tales 28/12/
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A mild London morning greeted us, our recent Christmas festivities were still fresh in our minds,
however, those snow-free memories were being quickly replaced with the thought of snow-dusted
Scottish valleys, rime-ice-covered rocks, and Icey gullies, but this was not to be the case. The 12 - hour
trip was long but never boring, interspersed with stories of winter’s past and our autumnal epics
hoping to replicate ICMC’s recent success on trips and be greeted with good weather. Psyche was
building the closer we got to the Scottish border, with Jerry Springer and Paolo Nutini creeping their
way onto the car stereo with greater frequency, with our Scottish music cultural dive only being
interrupted by news from the other car – Olly’s good old unreliable van. Packed with mission-critical
gear, Olly and his co-pilot Issy were unsure if there were going to make it to the Cairngorm car park in
anything other than a RAC recovery vehicle. Their vehicle was stricken with intense vibrations,
however, with only a short wait, the good Samaritan from the RAC fixed the fault which has resulted
from the ineptitude of a previous unnamed mechanic, as the front left wheel was not properly
attached. That was the last of days’ dramas, with everyone making it to the hut by the early hours of
the morning. Upon arrival, equipment was distributed, with Jake taking the fancy of a short ice screw
he affectionately named ‘shtubby’, whilst others were fixated on the ancient human ritual of fire
lighting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="day-2-route-recon-2912"&gt;Day 2 Route Recon 29/12
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group awoke with a
pre-dawn start, a theme
that persisted until the end
of the trip. With a mix of
experience within the
group, members with
winter climbing experience
(Ciaran, Olly, Piers, and
Jake) were to go to the
northern corries of Stob
Coire an t-Sneachda and
Cairn Lochan to access
conditions, whilst those
that didn’t (Alex, Issy, George, Ben) started a 2 - day introductory course ran by Ronald ‘Ron’ Walker, a local legend of the area. Ron is a naturally gifted and successful winter climber, with decades of
experience, with outstanding local knowledge to guide clients, and is a keen photographer with many
of his wintery shots filling the SMC guidebooks. With the groups splitting up, the learners received an
excellent course on winter mountaineering basics, cruising the class and exceeding expectations,
however, the same could not be said for the other group. Equipped with fully laden packs, reminiscent
of those used for the siege tactics of the early alpinists. After brushing up on rusty winter skills
including personal movement and ice axe arrests, they continued walking around to Lochan.
Unfortunately, both Sneachda and Lochan had been stripped of snow and ice by the recent high-
pressure system that was stubbornly refusing to leave Scotland at the time. The group was
disappointed, however, with Jake’s father and his Met Office connections we were informed that a
strong low-pressure system was coming soon. Such shifting conditions were on-theme for the season
so far, with the Scottish weather largely not cooperating with the needs of the many eager early-
season senders. Winds were picking up, with a yellow wind warning for the entire mountain range,
but the group was keen to not let the day go to waste. With the winds making any walk up to the
Cairngorm plateau too dangerous and frankly too miserable, we set our sights on a smaller peak
located North-East of Cairngorm – Castle hill. Standing at only 728 meters, its unimpressive height
camouflages it in the rugged background of the range, the only thing more unimpressive, was the
difficulty of ascending it that day. Cutting to the peaks’ south, with the wind behind them, the group
made the last ascent to the summit with 60mph winds physically lifting them up the entire way. With
such winds, Jake and Piers were initially blown past the summit, with Ciaran and Olly having to stand
aggressively leaning into the so that they didn’t tumble down the West side of the hill. With the day
thoroughly seized, the now wind-battered team regrouped with the novices in Aviemore for chips and
deep-fried haggis before heading back to the hut, pondering the potential events of the next day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="day-3---chasing-phantoms-3012"&gt;Day 3 - Chasing Phantoms 30/12
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overnight, the weather had turned. High winds had given
way to torrential showers high on the Munros. Ron opted to
push the second day of teaching back to the next day, and
with the group wanting to make the most of their time in the
mountaineering capital of the UK, we headed for the
Cummingston on the sun-baked eastern coast.
Cummingston, with a microclimate that typically opposes
that of the inner mountains of Scotland, is a wet weather
venue where one can retreat to for coastal sea cliff single-
pitch trad climbing. However, our bad luck continued, the
venue was thoroughly soaked with even the supposedly
‘weatherproof’ cave dripping wet. We regrouped at the car
park with the group only given one last potential objective –
the Cummingston car park playground. It contained
legendary rides including the spinning top, giant roundabout,
and the UKC checklist-approved gem of ‘the crag’ the &lt;em&gt;Metal
Slide on the approach to Cummingston&lt;/em&gt; Grade – I. Jake, with
his low center of mass and strong bouldering background,
flashed the problem, pinching the sides of the metal slide and
brute forcing his way to the top. Piers, having been
unsuccessful during his previous visits attempted the same, however, it was not to be, and Piers was forced to console his failure on the other rides. Though if
asked, he would never admit it, it was Piers’ highlight of the trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By now, word has spread amongst the group of a mythical truly weatherproof venue - Cauldron Rocks.
Located in Findhorn Gorge and only a short drive South-West of Cummingston, we made haste to the
crag to maximize the short winter day. Upon arrival, it became apparent that lacking a local map,
accurate approach notes, and – for some – a sense of direction that the crag would be almost
impossible to find. The group, led by George and Ben descended the correct gorge and eventually
found the unassuming boulders, but surprise surprise, they too were wet. Defeated, the group made
for the car park only to stop and for Olly and Ciaran to climb an impressive tree that would make for
a high-quality bivvy spot high off of the forest floor. With the rest of the group thoroughly impressed
and in need of chalk for our sweaty palms, we headed home, picking up Isaac on the way from
Aviemore station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="day-4---fingers-ridge-fools-3112"&gt;Day 4 - Fingers Ridge Fools 31/12
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fourth day started with the group splitting for the last time, the novices would complete their final
day of training with Ron, whilst the other 5 would ascend the highest mountain in the range – Ben
Macdui. With air temperature approaching double digits, and the rain thoroughly stripping all but the
deepest of gullies of their snow, the group used the approach to assess the damage in Sneachda and
see if anything had survived. Walking to the base of the corrie, and ascending the goat track to the
plateau, the group was amazed to see a fully kitted up party roping up to attempt &lt;em&gt;Fingers Ridge (IV 5)&lt;/em&gt;
with the route being so bear, not even Page 3 would consider exploiting its currently naked state for
individual gain. Olly mentioned the complete disregard for ethics, however, the rest were too
absorbed in ascending the goat track, for it was the first time most has donned crampons and axes in
over a year. Once on the plateau, the team made quick work of walking to the summit of Ben Macdui, only stopping for the tourist pastime of summit photos, and trying to glissade down the northern
slopes by any means. With the visibility becoming worse, the quintet hastened their descent to the
car park, taking the western path down Lochan, with Ciaran setting an unachievable pace that the
others could not match. The reason for such pace was not his concern for the safety of the party due
to the hazardous low visibility, but his concern for the safety of his underwear. The pace of his descent
was so impressive that we believed it was a new speed record for a running (interspaced with
waddling) descent of Ben Macdui to the Cairngorm Car Park toilets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entertainment continued during the car ride back to the hut, with Olly – a concerned
environmentalist – taking to the UKC forums to ethical shortcomings of the punters we had seen
earlier that day*. Such a post became an instant hotbed of self-righteous climbers appalled by the lack
of respect exhibited earlier that day, with such outrage from the community highlighting the strict
ethics of British mountaineering, with this time ICMC not on the hot end of the climbing ethics debate
(having historically had that one time a student decided to stupidly dry tool a route a millstone, and
narrowly escape Sheffield with his identity still unknown.) The post, alongside the boardgames, Scrawl
and Set provided the evening’s entertainment for the NYE festivities, climaxing with the official
coronation of the incumbent ICMC president.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&gt;https://www.ukclimbing.com/forums/winter_climbing/fingers_ridge_fools-742579&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="day-5---yearly-traditions-0101"&gt;Day 5 - Yearly Traditions 01/01/
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We awoke, riddled with hangovers and the false promises of a New Year’s Day fry-up. Some
particularly fragile members of the group stayed behind to hold the fort, whilst the rest scouted out
the nearby crag, Creag Dhubh, just outside Newtonmore. The group managed to go three for three
‘weatherproof’ climbing venues, with the crag still wet from previous rainfall and the spray from the
nearby waterfall. At this moment, tired of coming up empty-handed, George and Isaac hatched a
plan to climb the rarely sent route &lt;em&gt;Oui Oui&lt;/em&gt; beneath the waterfall and vowed to return later that
week, clad head to toe in Gore-Tex to climb the unconventional route_._ With the forecast predicting
sub zeros temperature for the next day, the evening was spent recovering and preparing to take the
novices out on their first proper winter climbs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="day-6---blowing-away-the-cobwebs-0201"&gt;Day 6 - Blowing away the cobwebs 02/01
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the hangovers of New Year’s quickly becoming a distant memory, the group was ready for a
passing of the torch from the experienced to inexperienced members. Jacob’s Ladder (I) is renowned
for being a particularly stubborn route to disappear, like Raebrun’s Gully (III) and the high gullies (3- 5
(I)) on The Ben, the route can survive all but the most extended and intense heatwaves. The group,
keen to oil their old rusty winter skills, made haste with an early start as it was likely many other
parties were going to rely on ol’ reliable that day. Walking into the bottom of Sneachda there was little
change in the amount of snow compared to two days prior. The group paired up, roped up, and formed the traditional ‘novice send train’ one typically sees on Jacob’s ladder early season when few other climbs have the depth of snow to be in condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of the day, everyone had had their taste of Scottish winter climbing at the sharp end, even
if the route in question becomes a motorway for soloists looking for a speedy way to reach the top of
Sneachda. Alex bumped into some old friends from Durham university whilst leading the route –
another repeating theme for the trip. Once at the top, there was little else to do apart from the yearly
pilgrimage to the top of Cairn Gorm Mountain. Standing at 1245m, it is one of the highest peaks in
Scotland, and the weather station at its summit frequently records the highest winds each year, just
standing on the summit that day felt like sticking your head out of a car driving on the motorway!
Thoroughly battered and thrilled for one day, the group descended the north-western slopes of Cairn
Gorm parallel to the ski slopes, which were packed considering the lack of snowfall, and glissaded their
way back down to the Cairngorm café, before being on their way to Aviemore for haggis and chips
with a thorough drowning in gravy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="day-7---natures-waterslide-0301"&gt;Day 7 - Nature’s waterslide 03/01
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another uncharacteristically warm day greeted us, with the low-pressure weather band delaying its
arrival to the next day, other means of entertainment had to be found. With overnight rains drenching
the crags and more precited that morning, many sought refuge in the hut or spent the day making a
considerable dent in their maintenance loans with the assistance of the Aviemore shops. George and
Isaac had other plans; to scale the waterfall at Craig Dubh. They donned marigolds, and Gore-Tex suits,
resembling warriors about to do battle with the waves, and made their way to the crag for their rudimentary rack-cleaning session.
The base of the route was receiving a pounding
from the forceful waterfall above, the last week
of seemingly endless rain and mild temperatures
ensured the waterfall was flowing at full force.
Isaac tentatively dispatched the first pitch,
escaping to the right of the waterfall, and was
shielded from the spray by the above
overhanging rock. George has the pleasure of
leading pitch 2 and was not so lucky. He had to
take a direct line diagonally crossing the
waterfall, first facing the spray, then the full
force of crashing water from the waterfall The
rest of the climbing had a unique atmosphere as
the waterfall climbing was behind you, and now
the route climbed the rock beneath the falling
water, with delicate slab climbing moves and the
deafening sound of water crashing behind you,
it truly was a unique and memorable
experience. Reaching the top, thrilled with their
accomplishments, Gorge and Isaac prepared
and abseil and made it back to the car, escaping
benightment. Regrouping at the hut for a relaxing evening, fresh snow had started to fall outside and
it was not long before
snowball open warfare
erupted inside and out,
with Issy’s fantastic
Welsh being the only
thing that could bring
the cessation of
hostilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="day-8---storm-season-0401"&gt;Day 8 - Storm Season 04/01
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the potential for our first day of proper winter climbing, Ciaran had green-lit a plan to climb in
Sneachda. Unfortunately, with the week taking its toll on everyone, the day’s pre-dawn start had been
pushed back later and later as everyone fought for an extra ounce of sleep. High winds from the north
bringing heavy snow later in the day meant challenging weather from the get-go, demanding insight,
guile, and strategy from the group to pick the routes in the best condition. One had to consider
aspects, exposure, and the route’s reliance on frozen turf. Immediately most gullies were ruled out
due to the intense wind tunnel effect making upward progress hazardous and frankly miserable, this
led to the group settling for the Mess of Pottage buttress, to left (East) of &lt;em&gt;Jacob’s Ladder&lt;/em&gt; (I). Arriving at the Cairngorm base station, we stepped out of the cars with fresh crunchy snow underfoot, with a
feeling of pensiveness hovering amongst the group; with the car park unusually desolate following
early season snowfall, and the challenging conditions underfoot of snow-covered rotten ice, we knew
that the conditions would scare off all but the most determined climbers. The walk-in was a challenge,
the conditions underfoot combined with the high winds meant that skiing your way off the hardly
visible path was a certain, one just hoped to land in the soft heather over a drainage ditch. It quickly
became apparent that today’s conditions were not for all, Piers and Alex heeded caution over the
conditions and turned back to wait in the Ranger Station Café, with Issy soon to join them. They aimed
to join the rest later, hoping that the conditions would lift to provide a weather window for just a pitch
or two of a route.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unwavered by the wariness of the others, those that persevered split into two groups, with Ciaran,
Olly, and Ben aiming for the route &lt;em&gt;Hidden Chimney Direct&lt;/em&gt; (IV, 5 ), and George, Jake, and Isaac
attempting the open mixed terrain to the left of Jacob’s Ladder, encompassing, The Slant (I), Hidden
Chimney (III), and Jacob’s Edge (II). At the base of the route, conditions were just about good enough
with the surface turf being frozen and a thin layer of verglas covering the rock face. Ciaran psyched up
his crew and attempted the first pitch of &lt;em&gt;Hidden Chimney Direct&lt;/em&gt; , with a methodical and confident lead
of his first grade IV. Olly successfully followed to the 2nd belay, however, Ben found the conditions
challenging and the climbing alien. Having seen Ciaran successfully dispatch pitch 1, the other team wanted to second the first pitch on the top rope but strengthening winds and poor visibility forced
both teams to bail and escape up &lt;em&gt;Jacob’s Ladder&lt;/em&gt; , vowing to come back the following day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="day-9---go-hard-or-go-home-0501"&gt;Day 9 - Go Hard or Go Home 05/01
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last day of the trip presented the best conditions for the past few weeks. With more fresh snow,
the previous evening’s slight thaw, and the already compacted snow from 48 hours ago, the chances
of good conditions were high. With the last pre-dawn start behind them, the group made for the
Cairngorm car park, with Piers expertly saving his car from fishtailing on the drive to Aviemore, much
to the surprise of Olly in the passenger seat. The rewards for our efforts revealed themselves as we
were beaten to the car park and the base of the route only by those who had camped the night before.
Splitting up into the same groups as three days prior, Olly and Issy broke right from the main trail to
Sneachda to attempt the &lt;em&gt;Ficaill Ridge&lt;/em&gt; (II), Ciaran and Ben breaking trail to Fluted Buttress to attempt
&lt;em&gt;Red Wall&lt;/em&gt; (II), with Jake and George in tow, who themselves were to attempt &lt;em&gt;The Runnel&lt;/em&gt; (II), leaving
Piers, Isaac, and Alex to try &lt;em&gt;Hidden Chimney&lt;/em&gt; (III). Approach conditions were difficult; with the snow-
loaded western slopes of Fiacaill a’ Choire Chais necessitating a wide birth, groups heading to the
eastern side of the corrie were forced to navigate through the boulder field. Progress was slow and
tedious, with the fresh snow covering the boulders concealing their true shape, the trail-breakers had
to carefully pick their way over and around the boulders, whilst playing a game of minesweeper as
their boots risked breaking the ice below and ruining their day entirely. Piers, Issac, and, Alex were
joined by another team heading to Mess of Pottage and offered to split the boulder-navigating trail-breaking. Through casual chit-chat, the other team was headed to the same route, however, no
queueing was needed, as one of the climbers in their party broke through the ice and flooded both of
their boots, forcing a disappointing retreat to the car park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the teams made it to the base of their routes in good time, and with minimal queuing. Olly and Issy
climbed Fiaciall buttress to reach the ridge which had wonderfully varied climbing, allowing the
climber to choose the difficulty of the route. They quickly ascended the first pillar of the ridge climbing
30 ft to the main ridge walk and then the final obstacle, the main ridge itself. The most rewarding line
is a steep, stepped corner with various mantles which Issy sent with ease, leaving only the walk skirting
the corrie rim to reach the other groups further East. One buttress over, Ben and Ciaran were tackling
Red Gully on Fluted Buttress. The route takes an obscure line taking the natural fault right of Fingers
Ridge (IV, 5). The large narrow chimney at the base was banked with deep snow, giving challenging
climbing in the lower section, which continued to climb and increase in difficulty as they progressed.
Ciaran led the first pitch with Ben belaying on his knees to spare his feet from the cold snow. After the
first pitch, the route takes a dogleg right, taking sustained but easier mixed terrain until it opens out
into a funnel-shaped gully near beneath the lip of the plateau above. The pair made constant but slow
progress in the challenging conditions and deep snow, and with the setting sun, head torches and
sparks from Ciaran’s axe hitting the buried granite rocks lit the way to the top. The group was the last
to summit, with both George and Jake on The Runnel, and the Trio on Hidden chimney making light
work of their ascents. The Runnel is the striking central gully that sits highest on Fluted Buttress, the
long snow-plod into the gully rewards the climbers with beautiful, high-angle ice and neve all the way
to the top, leading to a final steep mixed chimney that is the crux of the route.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jake and George’s efforts were rewarded with good conditions on the lower and middle sections of
the route with good ice. Unfortunately, had unfaithfully left Schtubby back in the hut and was upset
that he had no screws to place on the route. With both lacking experience leading, they took their
time and carefully climbed the route taking in all the pleasures of climbing a crag classic route.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once all the teams had sent their routes, they rendezvoused at the top of Hidden Chimney on Mess
of Pottage, and much to the surprise of Isaac, were waiting for him at the topped-out the final pitch.
The trio of Isaac, Piers, and Alex had been slowed by their numbers and the need for diligent route
finding. Starting the day at the busy base of Jacob’s Ladder, Isaac started up the first pitch which climbs
the gully of Jacob’s Ladder for 25m then breaks left, climbing through the natural dip in the left gully
wall to gain the vast buttress. The deep snow complicated gear finding and thus finding suitable belay
stances, but after the traverse of the first pitch, Piers took the reigns to continue diagonally up the
buttress blinding following a natural diagonal break until the route’s final crux pitch reveals itself.
Upon reaching the third belay, Piers belayed Isaac then Alex, with (surprise surprise) Jonty - Alex’s
friend – in tow, who complained about a slow-moving but thoroughly psyched party (Jake and George)
that had hampered their earlier progress on The Runnel. After a brief catchup, and with dying light
and temperatures dropping, Isaac led the stunning final pitch, containing the bridging-move-filled
chimney, all the way to the plateau and the awaiting groups above. Piers and Alex followed on, chasing
the sound of the faint cheers and heckles of those above as they reveled in the successes of the day.
Once regrouped at the top of the plateau, the group made their way to the Chais ridge under the light
of a bright moonrise, and back to the car park to get ready for the long trip back to London the next
morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tour-review"&gt;Tour Review
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;With technical mixed climbing completed by everyone in the group, one could argue that it was a
success, given the relatively slim chances of having good conditions during a trip so early in the winter
season. Typically, during late December and early January, climbing is possible, but the quality can
vary due to the temperature being too high for sustained freeze-thaw cycles, which leads to the build-
up of ice and deep snow, both on the buttresses and faces. Without these cycles, when new snow
falls, it lingers in its powdery state before melting completely, which doesn’t provide the best
conditions and easily makes climbing 1-2 grades harder due to the lack of extra pick and crampon
placements which are provided by the bonding ice, thus also making other placements feel insecure
and requiring greater balance and technique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The novices amongst the group received in-depth instruction and guidance into Scottish winter
climbing, which should provide a valuable base for future winter tours and experience that can be
used for future expeditions to The Alps and Alaska, however, limited opportunities to further develop
these skills on lead will stunt progress. More advanced members of the group completed their
objective – to have fun – with many agreeing that it was one of their better winter trips in recent
memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="closing-remarks-and-future-plans"&gt;Closing Remarks and Future Plans
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the success of the tour is best highlighted by the group’s desire to return to the northern
corries in the future, with all members either intending to return for the tour next year or return later
in the season for more winter climbing in better conditions! ICMC wholeheartedly wishes to return to
the northern Cairngorms for another winter tour in 2022/23 and train the next generation of Imperial
students in the niche skills used in Scottish winter mountaineering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="attendees"&gt;Attendees
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current members&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alex Smith, Catherine Spilsbury, Jennifer Hack, Charlotte Krishek, Stuart McClune, Rowan Dixon, Elizabeth Porter, Sonny Burniston&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Life members&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William Jones&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="aims-and-objectives"&gt;Aims and Objectives
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our aim of the tour was for new and proficient members to gain more experience in winter
mountaineering to allow them to practice winter climbing safely. We hope that these skills will allow
members to both plan their own winter trips and keep winter skills active in the club.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also a great base for building future mountaineering and alpine skills that would be great to
further instil within the club.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="objectives"&gt;Objectives
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For new members to gain key winter skills, including avalanche safety, route planning,
equipment choice, self-arrest, movement skills and pick placement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Members with more experience should begin to practice leading winter routes
independently to cement the skills they developed in previous years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improve general summer mountaineering skills, including navigation and route planning, on
the lower hills or munros (weather permitting).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Introduce the concept of dry tooling to improve pick and crampon placement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, we felt we achieved the aims of the tour. Charlotte, Stuart, Sonny and Rowan were
instructed on winter skills for two days with a guide that gave them essential winter skills and more!
Lizzie used the second day of the course to refresh her existing winter skills. Jen and Alex honed their
winter skills from last year by leading their first winter route. Cat and Will practiced moving together
quickly over easier ground. Munro bagging on Bynack More allowed us to practice our navigation
skills and a day in Newtyle Quarry introduced the group to dry tooling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="tour-log"&gt;Tour log
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An early start for everyone on the first day of the winter break as we met at the Union at 6am! With
the back of the bus piled with climbing gear and sleepy climbers, we started our 550-mile journey to
the Cairngorms. Jen and Alex heroically drove the 10-hour journey between them. Stopping only for
a tour of the UKs service stations and to stock up on food for the week, we made good time and
arrived at a little cottage in Nethy Bridge – our home for the next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the early start the previous day, we were keen to make the most of the snow! Leaving the
new members for an extended sleep before meeting their guide, Jen, Alex, Cat and Will set off to
Coire an t-Sneachda to start our walk in at first light. Despite nearly walking into the wrong coire, we
made a speedy approach to the base of our routes. Cat and Will started up Spiral Gully (II), but due
to driving rain and the first pitch comprising of a pile of slush, backed off and made their way back to
wring out their clothes and drink hot chocolate. Jen and Alex made their way slowly but surely up
the Runnel (II). A classic winter route that usually does not involve an extensive rocky chimney pitch,
but lack of good snow upped the challenge! A fantastic first winter route for both Jen and Alex!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the rest of the group met up with their guide who talked them through the basics
before taking them out for some practice in the northern coires. Soon the group were practicing
cutting steps, ice axe arrests and winter navigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a cold day for everyone, we headed back to the house for some well-deserved showers and
dinner!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After swinging by Aviemore train station to pick up Lizzie, we headed back to Sneachda. Most of the
group continuing with their guide to consolidate a few more winter skills and have a go at putting
them in to practice. Ending their skills course with a hidden gem – an unmelted ice pitch!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jen, Alex, Cat and Will made the most of the clear day and beautiful weather by tackling Ficalli Ridge.
Not only could we practice moving together, but it offered incredibly views of Coire an Snechda and
lochan!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After two days of (somewhat) winter conditions, our luck run out. The weather turned warm and
rainy with strong winds, so we headed for the coast in search of dry rock and milder weather! After
scouring UKC we came across a crag full of promise! Sea cliff trad in an idyllic location, what could go
wrong? Unfortunately, when we arrived at the crag we began to realise why it didn’t receive much
traffic! Covered in a thick layer of yellow lichen and dripping wet despite the sun, even the boldest of
us didn’t fancy the abseil down to the sea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/winter-tour-2017/images/seaside.jpg"
alt="Looking down at the yellow, lichenous rocks." width="300"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking down at the yellow, lichenous rocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Determined not to waste the day (or the long drive), we headed back to the bus and continued
another 20 minutes down the coast to a crag we had enjoyed the previous year. After a brief detour
to a ruined castle and navigating around the collapsing coastal path, we arrived at a secluded rocky
outcrop. A little wet and not the biggest of crags, but it packed in some good routes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stuart cruised up a slabby Bladder Wrack (S 4b), utilising probably the most unnecessary heel hook
ever used in ICMC. Lizzy led her first HS, Fisherman’s Tail, and demonstrated excellent trad face.
Charlotte battled her way up the soggy Poacher (VS 4 b), learning that gear can be your friend –
especially when pumped!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With no sign of winter returning, the group looked for another way to practice their axe placement
and show off those lock offs – dry tooling at Newtyle Quarry!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/winter-tour-2017/images/drytool.jpg"
alt="Alex crushing at Newtyle." width="300"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alex crushing at Newtyle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jen, Will and Cat opted for a walk in the nearby forests, taking in the gorgeous local scenery.
Finishing up early, they made a start on a full roast dinner with all the trimmings for that night’s
dinner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 6&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We sadly had to say goodbye to Sonny and popped him on an early morning train home. To make
the most of the early start, we decided to take everyone on a long walk. Still in darkness we left the
minibus at Glenmore Lodge and started the climb up to Bynack More (1090m). We were treated to
beautiful views of sunrise over the Cairngorms as we went.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/winter-tour-2017/images/sunrise.jpg"
alt="Sunrise on the approach to Bynack More." width="300"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunrise on the approach to Bynack More.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having reached the summit in excellent time, we decided to continue the day taking in A’Choinneach
(1017m) and Cairn Gorm (1245m) itself. We gratefully stopped in the warmth of the café for hot
chocolate and cake before descending back to the minibus. Unfortunately, some bridges marked on
the map were distinctly absent and an impromptu river crossing left everyone with soggy shoes! We
headed home to start dinner and find somewhere to dry out eight pairs of shoes!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 7&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For our last full day in the Cairngorms, we were determined to try and pack in some climbing. We set
off to a hidden gem, suggested by Jen, Huntly’s Cave. Our hearts sank as we drove closer, the rock
was looking less than dry. In time old ICMC tradition, we filed out the bus to touch the wet rock. It
turns out we weren’t entirely right. It wasn’t just wet. It was covered in a fine layer of frost. While
most of us were content to gaze at the incredible assortment of blocky, overhung routes and dream
of summer, Charlotte is never one to back down from a challenge. She geared up and started up an
impressively damp and slimy route. We watched, shouted encouragements and ate popcorn while
she made her way up. Jen followed and confirmed it was a heinously slippery route. Not encourage
by this review, we made an executive decision to retreat to a quaint tea shop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That evening, the house was filled with activity as everybody worked on their Secret Santa present
and Jen cooked her eagerly awaited ‘Nutty Bol’. Dinner was a treat, copious amounts of mulled wine
was drunk and a fabulous array of homemade gifts were swapped. Altogether not a bad way to end
a trip!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 8&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got up early to do a final sweep of the house and started on our long journey back. Jen and Alex,
our absolute superstars, drove us back to London. The rest of the group slept the majority of the
journey back, dreaming that Christmas would bring some better winter conditions!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Food shopping&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stop at the Tesco Superstore just off the M9 past Glasgow in Stirling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SPAR in Nethy Bridge is next door but has sporadic opening hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Climbing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Winter: Coire an Sneachda is a 30-minute drive from Nethy Bridge and has the shortest walk in. It
has a good selection of winter routes for beginners. Coire an Lochain is approached from the same
car park and also has a few good routes to start out. Park at the Cairngorm funicular railway and ski
centre car park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Summer: If it’s wet in the mountains, the coast is a good alternative. Logie Head has a selection of
nice routes at varying grades. See the North East Outcrops guidebook. Huntly’s Cave is in good
proximity to Nethy Bridge and has a number of overhanging trad routes at all grades that may be dry
when surrounding rock is wet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dry tooling: Newtyle Quarry is a bolted slate quarry that is good for a day of dry tooling. The routes
start at M3 and have a couple of other easy routes.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Winter tour 2015</title><link>YAYAYA/p/winter-tour-2015/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>YAYAYA/p/winter-tour-2015/</guid><description>&lt;img src="YAYAYA/YAYAYA/p/winter-tour-2015/images/0.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Winter tour 2015" /&gt;&lt;h1 id="icmc-winter-tour-report"&gt;ICMC Winter Tour Report

&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;As has been the case for the last few years the club returned to the Cairngorms. Our usual
accommodation just behind the train station in Aviemore was not available as the trip ran later in the year
than usual. Instead we stayed in Nethy Bridge, about 20 minutes further away. The trip saw mild conditions
turning colder as the week went on. Any routes that were completed were generally quite lean and icy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bought food on the way up in Glasgow, completed shop in a record time of 1 ¼ hrs! For the final leg
of the journey Jo took ascended as DJ managing to carefully choose the best dramatic music resulting in the
perfect ambiance as we approached our destination at 9pm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="day-2"&gt;Day 2
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Very lean conditions, James, Will and Tom attempted Red Gully (II) but backed off because the ice
that forms the back of the route turned into a stream! Headed over to Fiacaill Coulouir (III) which was a bit
bare at the top but a brilliant route non-the less, they then dropped off back to the carpark down Fiacaill
Ridge which was bare and in summer condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicolau honed his self arresting skills, Charlie lost his white helmet in the snow and Cat started her
winter skills course with Cairngorm Adventure Guides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knut cooked us all an interesting German noodle dish, which was very very very filling. Went well
with beer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="day-3"&gt;Day 3
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Snow, snow everywhere, but not much to climb. Cat completed her first winter route with Sam her
guide, Central Gully (I). Everybody else went up and round the back of Lochan topping out through The
Couloir (I/II), we then headed over to Ben Macdui and then finally down the goat track. A brilliant day ended
with some yummy carbonara which was mainly cream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="day-4"&gt;Day 4
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A warmer day meant we headed back to Cummingstone on the Moray Coast, about an hours drive
north. After a good experience last year we were not disappointed again, climbing the relatively short and
welcoming crags on the coastline is welcome relief from being blasted by spindrift on the tops of the
Cairngorm Plateau. A local, who we had met the previous day heading back to the car park, congratulated us
on our decision to head to ‘Marvoulous Moray’ it seems to be the place to go when the weather turns a bit
naff in the mountains. We had roast pork for dinner and filled the house with roast potatoes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="day-5"&gt;Day 5
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Great conditions! We split the groups up a little as Cat had just finished her course and Georgia was joining us from Liverpool MC. Jo, James and Nicolau completed Red Gully (II) and found the torque nut that Will had left earlier in the week. Jon, Knut and Chris climbed the seam (IV), Tom Charlie and Sally climbed Central Gully and Will Georgia and Cat climbed the Runnel which was very icy at the top! All parties topped out a similar time and were back in the carpark by nightfall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everybody was a bit knackerd and the snow was melting, but a group of us headed over to
Cairngorm Mountain and went sledging using survival bags. We also saw some reindeer! Secret santa
ensued with £0 budget. The prolific Icy MC clothing range was expanded to new heights again this year! We
cooked about 10 litres of fish pie for dinner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="day-7"&gt;Day 7
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poor conditions, extremely high winds (+130mph), and a warm outlook mean that we cut the trip
short and headed home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="financial-breakdown"&gt;Financial Breakdown
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tiny profit due to some rounding errors in ticket income calculation. The low cost per head of just over £ 90
was due mainly to the accommodation being half the price it was last year and spending nearly more than
£100 less on food (less cheese, alcohol and meat was purchased). The slightly higher tour allocation was also
useful!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main objective of this trip was to have fun while staying safe, which everyone
agreed we managed successfully. Another important objectives was to teach less
experienced members of the club how to winter climb, so that the skills and knowledge
that they acquired would stay in the club and be passed on in later years. There were
five students who took part in the introductory course, at least four of which will be
staying on Imperial fot at least another year, and so this was also a success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;After an early start of meeting at 7am, we packed up the bus at lightning speed and were
soon on the road facing a 14 hour journey to Scotland. The drive went smoothly with only
a few Traffic jams, and we stopped en route to carry out our food shop for the week. This
turned out to be super efficient, as we split into smaller groups and charged round the
shop grabbing the items we needed. We were soon back on the bus on the way to the
house. We arrived at the house in the late evening. After greeting the Argor, we all went
to shotgun rooms. Joel and Will were particularly fast at claiming their double bed. As
the only girl on the trip, Jo claimed her own room, and the rest of the group split
between the other rooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="day-2-16th-december"&gt;Day 2: 16th December
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our guide Kevin arrived early in the morning, and went through some general safety
with the novices. It was decided that the weather would be too bad to go out into the
mountains, and so instead we head up to Cummingston, Elgin, a crag well known for
staying dry when the weather is bad further north.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This well named crag turn out to be very idyllic, and Kevin spent the day teaching
novices rope work techniques that would be useful in winter climbing. The rest of the
group played around the coastline trad routes, which were all great fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="day-3-17th-december"&gt;Day 3: 17th December
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the second day of Kevin&amp;rsquo;s course the weather was a bit better, and so he took the
novices out into the mountains to teach winter skills. The rest of the group split in two -­‐
Will and Jo went on a walk that did not require crampons (due to the group lacking one
set of them), and the others went up a grade I route on the Coire an t’Sneachda. All of the
parties had great amount of fun, and even the sun decided to join them in the afternoon
for a while. Jo and Will took the extremely scenic route back to the bus, which involved
cross country walking through bracken and snow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="day-4-18th-december"&gt;Day 4: 18th December
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group split into teams of threes, with one novice going with two experienced
members. We all climbed on different routes across the Coire an t’Sneachda. Although
incredibly windy, the weather held out throughout the day, and all of the teams
eventually topped out successfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="day-5-19th-december"&gt;Day 5: 19th December
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Due to bad weather conditions, the group took an enforced rest day. The gear was
sorted and cleaned, and we had a walk into Aviemore town to peruse the gear shops
before deciding not to buy anything. Charlie, Tom and Jo went on a walk in the local
area. The rest of the team stayed in the house watching Scottish TV, before driving over
to Inverness to watch the new Anchorman II film. The evening was spent continuously
refreshing the weather forecast in hope of good conditions for day six.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="day-6-20nd-december"&gt;Day 6: 20nd December
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;After initial concerns about the weather, an update showed that the conditions would be
fine for climbing, and so the minibus set off for Coire an t’Sneachda. This time a couple of
teams head over to Coire an Lochain. The day was semi-­‐successful. The conditions,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;although not terrible, gave a lot of spindrift on the routes, and very powdery snow. Many
of the teams decided to retreat after experiencing issues on the routes, such as large
cornices when trying to top out. Retreating meant late returns to the bus, and as the car
park was closed at night, a couple of the teams, on eventually reaching the car park, then
had to walk down the hill to the barrier.
Once all back at the house, clothing was strewn over the Argor, and dramatic tales of
defeat were shared at the dinner table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="day-7-21nd-december"&gt;Day 7: 21nd December
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the various defeats of the previous day, and with the conditions set to continue
worsening, it was decided to flee to the one dry tooling crag that Scotland has -­‐ Newtyle
Quarry. Everyone spent some time scaring themselves on dry tooling routes in the
pouring rain, before retiring to the pub. Once back at the house, an impressive effort was
put into the dinner, and we all enjoyed a roast dinner with crumble for pudding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="day-8-22nd-december"&gt;Day 8: 22nd December
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Home time! Everyone got up early, and an impressive group effort meant the bus was
packed and the house cleaned in record time. We were soon on the road home, feeling
psyched for next year’s Scottish winter climbing already.&lt;/p&gt;

After an unusually uneventful drive we arrived early at the accommodation and as such were unequipped to deal with
dinner. An early search party set off in search of takeaway, unfortunately the chip shop was closed,
but further trekking revealed a Tesco’s selling microwave pizzas. There was much rejoicing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day began with Aviemore’s finest in winter safety instruction, the mighty Kevin, arriving to talk the novices through their first day in the mountains. Meanwhile, the passion wagon, plus Hamzah,
had already packed camp and headed for the snow. The main party followed in hot pursuit, eventually
meeting them in the bottom of the coire. Kevin promptly got the novices running about in the snow
learning the gentlemen’s rules of a snowball fight, how to ice axe arrest, move on ice and snow and
how to judge snow conditions incase they are dangerously yellow. Hamzah, Ruth and Fresher set off
on their siege attempt of Invernookie (III) and Tom, Ben and Kip began what they believed to be
Fingers Ridge (IV) but after Ben spent 2 hours leading a pitch by the seat of his pants it became evident that this was in fact not the case. After a quick reconsideration, the group bravely ran away,
away to Red Gully (III) on the right before the ground steepened and became a crux pitch of what
turned out to Fingers Ridge Direct (VII). The main party reconvened at the car park and headed home
to construct a dish resembling a pasta carbonara and were eventually joined by the Invernookie team.
There was much rejoicing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the second day, Kevin was met at the car park and the novices set off to do their first route, Aladdin’s Couloir (I) and much fun was had. Tom, Ben
and Kip set off to try Aladdin’s mirror direct (IV), with Tom dispatching the
crux ice pitch in his standard visually pleasing manor. Team snow hole +1
went to do the Runnel (II) and, after Hamzah pretended to be a sledge for a
bit, abseiled back down and responsibly had Hamzah checked over by a
mechanic to have the dents beaten out. After it was made apparent that all
was well, chili was consumed by all, and there was much rejoicing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having completed their instruction, it was time for the novices to shed the surly bonds of snow and get on the rock. After a pre dawn walk in and it
becoming apparent that John and Knut are in fact powered by uranium, Tom
and Ben bravely lead two novices each (Knut, Jo, Joel and John) up Hidden
Chimney (III). This was a successful venture with both teams topping out at
around midday. These were soon joined by Kip and Tim (whose name is Tim)
who had successfully lead the Runnel (II) and retrieved the gear and axes left
by the previous days tobogganing. As the weather was so glorious, and the
day was but young, an assent of Cairngorm was devised. Pairs geared up and
battled up the tough 40º incline. Once summited people became happy, then
naked, then happy. Fresher, Hamzah and Ruth had a rest day. There was
much rejoicing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Winter skipped spring and summer and became autumn and conditions become unclimbable. A team of elite connoisseurs ventured to the Tomatin distillery car park,
and eventually visitor’s centre. Once all the available
knowledge and whisky had been absorbed a historically
accurate roast dinner of biblical proportion was made and
consumed followed by enough pudding to fill an ant the size
of a house. There was much rejoicing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the weather was still awful, a trip to Newtyle Quarry was commissioned. After some dry tooling and the
invention of the crampon smear and running man
techniques, it was determined that the weather was indeed
awful. The trip bravely ran away, away to the pub. After
some cracking nosh and a pint or two the trip reconvened
back at the house. A game of hide and seek later and diner
was ready. People became hungry, then happy, then full.
The following events that followed were a bit too much like
fun to be mentioned in a Scottish winter report, needless to say that several ventured to Aviemore’s
finest after dinner amusement, The Vault (VI). There was much rejoicing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friday came and still the bad weather persisted. Some people went shopping, then some other people went shopping. Later, after hours of graft, Tim invented the snowball cocktail. Some people watched
TV, someone did some work, some people talked of how they should do work. Eventually a traditional
Christmas dinner of spaghetti bolognaise was eaten and it was time for the ICMC secret Santa. People
became happy, then thankful, then Joel became sad. There was much rejoicing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Sunday we left. There was much rejoicing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main objective was to have fun and everyone agreed that we&amp;rsquo;d met this goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An important secondary objective of the tour was to introduce younger members of the
club to winter climbing with the hope that the skills they acquired would stay in the club
for years to come. As no-one sold their boots afterwards I would consider this achieved!
The main difficulties of winter climbing for the club are the long drive, variable conditions
and the high cost of entry. It is hoped that with the recent purchase of boots (joint with
outdoor club) will remove one of the most expensive purchases that aspiring mountaineers
have to make (boots are ~£300) and will increase participation in this sport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Ben Coope&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tom Wheeler&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hamzah&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tour-diary"&gt;Tour Diary
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id="day-one"&gt;Day one
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting an early start for the 14 hour bus journey to Scotland we packed up the
bus in record time and set off at 10am. Our excitement reached unprecedented levels
when the first flakes of snow were spotted on the M6. Unfortunately this caused a traffic
jam, but we managed to avoid it with a scenic tour of Staffordshire.
The trip almost ended for two of the tour&amp;rsquo;s members when they decided to save
some money by buying some bread and chicken from a M&amp;amp;S at a service station. All was
going well, until a comment from Ben about how the chicken was a little squishy lead to
the discovery of cooking instructions, Tom had already wolfed the whole packet&amp;hellip;
Fortunately all was well, and much fun was had in Glasgow’s Tescos buying food before
arriving at our palace for the week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="day-two"&gt;Day two
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;First day of climbing for the more experienced members and the first day of winter
skills course for the novices. The guide Kevin came to the palace to talk us through what
we would be doing, he changed his plan from a two day winter skills course to a one day
winter skills course and a day climbing an easy route.
The first day we got used to walking around in the snow, wearing crampons, using
iceaxes, self belays and self arrests. The day was tiring but great fun. Kevin took the
novices back to the palace and we got started on food. Roast pork with potatoes and veg.
Parsons and friends arrived late in the evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="day-three"&gt;Day Three
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again the older members went to do some climbing of their own before having to
supervise the novices. Kevin and the novices set off up a grade I climb, with Tom, Ben,
Hamzah and Ruth getting their first winter climb! This was very valuable as Kevin was able
to solo around the leaders (something that we would not be able to do as a club) showing
them how to find gear placements in the snow and demonstrating winter specific belay
techniques.
The novices got down early again and got on with food, Roast lamb shoulder (reduced from
Tesco) with rice, mash and veg. Parsons’ crew were impressed with our culinary
skills&amp;hellip;perhaps we could increase them with a cooking course?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="day-four"&gt;Day Four
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joe took Tom and Ben up the Slant (grade II) splitting it into three pitches to give the two
novices a good chance of leading. Joe’s team topped out first due to alpine efficiency and
got off the mountain in good time. James took Hamzah up the same route as Joe’s team
with James leading the whole route in the recommended two pitches. Jonathan took Ruth
up a slightly harder route with Jonathan leading both pitches, first route climbed with
overhanging steps! (variation of Hidden Chimney) At the top the two separate parties
bumped into each other and agreed to navigate off together. Conditions were sub-optimal
with strong winds(gusting up to 50mph), minimal visibility and heavy snow. However, good
navigational skills from Jonathan in challenging conditions got us safely off and back to the
bus where Joe’s party were ready and waiting for us. Dinner was cooked by Parsons’
group chilli and there was gateaux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/winter-tour-2011/images/1.jpg" width="300"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="day-five"&gt;Day Five
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joe, Tom and Ben wanted to try the route Jonathan and Ruth did the day before so set off
early for a day on the hill whilst everyone else took a well earned rest day. Bourbons with
whipped cream were eaten in abundance in the command palace. Dinner was cheesy-eggy-
pasta with sausages and veg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="day-six"&gt;Day Six
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Raining at all altitudes” – were not the words we wanted to hear and looking out the
window the previously picturesque white landscape had transformed to a patchy white,
green and mostly brown view. For the group who had a rest day on day five this was very
disappointing, but unavoidable. So we took a trip to Avimore, but didn’t have time for a
trip to a distillery. The evening was spent playing hide and seek, with more obscure and
precarious places found as the night progressed. Dinner was curry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="day-seven"&gt;Day seven
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The long drive home, with a slightly detoured route to drop Joe, James, Ruth and Ben at
various locations on route. We were also able to pick up some winter boots jointly bought&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;by ICMC and Outdoor Club.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Edward Poore&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-1"&gt;Day 1
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although each of the seven tour members were departing from different locations about the
country, everyone managed to get to Gloucester for around 1pm on the 2nd January. From here we
packed up the cars and headed off to North Wales and the St Mary’s hut. The roads were fairly icy
and snowy and so going was fairly slow. However, everyone managed to arrive at the hut around
8pm. A fire was started as quickly as possible to heat up the ice cold hut!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-2"&gt;Day 2
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first day of climbing and the group split into two with Al, Lisa, Alex and Ed heading off to explore
the local trad crags, while Danny, Tom and Joe drove up to the much famed ‘cave of justice’.
Although there had been some rain and snow the days before both groups had good dry rock and
lots of good climbing was done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-3"&gt;Day 3
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conditions were a bit dryer the next day and everyone headed off to a nearby crag to try some
multi-pitch climbing. That is after the hour or so of pushing the cars up the snowy and icy track
outside the hut, with the landrover racing ahead! After a good while scrambling around and
discussing (or arguing?!) where the routes started everyone managed to get going. For Lisa and Alex
this was their first multi-pitch experience and they coped very well with Lisa leading the final pitch of
her climb. After everyone was down in one piece Al and Joe decided that with an hour of sun left they would attempt another route. What at first looked like a route in fact turned into a gardening
expedition! However, only one piece of gear was lost and both returned down in one piece, albeit in
the darkness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-4"&gt;Day 4
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rain hit overnight and so it was decided that bouldering was the safest option. A quick drive to
Llanberis pass revealed the boulder field snowed under. That’s when the mayhem began. Snowballs
began flying from every direction as climbers found cover behind the problems they were planning
on attempting. Some beautiful head shots were achieved by throwing blind over cover until Ed
returned with lunch in the Landrover. The decision was then made to drive to a fairly far off crag on
the coast where it was hoped that the weather would be better. It wasn’t! Still some of the
beginners managed to get their first experience of bouldering in the snow and a couple of the older
members had a nice swim in the sea!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lisa and Alex left this evening&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-5"&gt;Day 5
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again conditions were better and everyone headed off together. The first problem struck when
Danny realized he was driving on a flat tyre! So the tyre was replaced and we headed back to the
hut. Then on our way back out Al’s car came a cropper on the ice and one tyre was slashed! With
two cars hobbling we decided to head to the nearest city and replace all the damaged wheels. With
lots of frustrated climbers itching to get on some rock it was decided to go back to Parisella’s cave
and attempt some night bouldering! This worked great with a land rover parked facing the crag with
the lights on and some excellent climbing was had. After getting home to the hut the traditional
roast dinner was started&amp;hellip; four hours later at about midnight dinner was served! After everyone had
woken up and eaten, a fair system was implemented to decide whom should wash up – the loser of
a game of forks. The president, Tom was so keen to avoid the washing up, that he stabbed Al with
the fork in order to ensure his safety from the greasy pans. Finally everyone went to bed tired but
cheerful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-6"&gt;Day 6
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the final day we decided to try and get some more climbing done in the morning and headed to
the local bouldering area in the Llanberis pass. Most boulders were topped with snow but a few bits
were under cover and some decent climbing was had by all. Then we all headed home and everyone
got back without incident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the tour was a success. No fundamental changes to the trip organisation are
recommended although perhaps a greater appreciation of the weather conditions could have been
useful, both in the areas of travel as well as climbing conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financially, the trip made a marginal profit (£7!). We spent no money on accommodation, we spent
£259 on food and a total of £250 on petrol. We received £167 in grants from the union and changed
£50 for the trip&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Climbing was done every day and an excellent time was had by all.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
