&lt;p&gt;“One for the history books” can only begin to describe the experience that was Fresher’s Trip 2025. This is a long one, so I have graciously included an abstract for TLDR purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="abstract"&gt;Abstract
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2025 Fresher’s Trip was an eventful blend of climbing, chaos, and mechanical misadventure. Over the course of the trip, twenty-five climbers navigated all the challenges that the weekend had to offer - from shattered minibus windows and rogue fireworks to the infamous Double Meat Junction, midnight creek swims and dangerously competitive boulder-pad wrestling matches. Freshers and veterans alike demonstrated remarkable resilience and creativity, executing improvised window repairs, heroic minibus hill starts and questionable feats of boulder-pad engineering. Despite the obstacles, the trip concluded successfully, with all participants returning to London slightly battered, but immensely entertained and with a renewed sense of ICMC camaraderie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-journey"&gt;The Journey
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We set off on a chilly Friday night, twenty five keen climbers packed into one minibus and two cars, £60 worth of Library Café cakes in hand and a long drive ahead. After a few games of Fireboy and Watergirl (Fig.1), we formulated a game plan. Benedict’s car would pick up Zak and the last few bits of gear from Westway. Isaac’s car would stop off at Wynsee’s house to collect a couple sleeping mats. The minibus would head to the Earl’s Court Tesco Superstore to pick up Jeremy, Arush and the all-important food shop. With the vehicles loaded, 13 wide-eyed freshers aboard and spirits high, we set off for The Peak District - only 45 minutes later than anticipated (Fig.2)!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a promising start. One that lasted approximately 15 minutes, at which point the two cars received word of the weekend’s first misfortune.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-window"&gt;The Window
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The incident occurred deep within the treacherous lanes of the Earl’s Court Tesco Superstore car park at around 19:00. While attempting an ambitiously tight left-hand turn, the minibus made contact with one of the walls and the left passenger window shattered all over poor Seamus (Fig.3,4).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/freshers-trip-2025/images/20251024_180110277_iOS.webp" width="200"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, no one was hurt as a result of the accident and the passengers swiftly evacuated the vehicle. Faced with the possibility of having to cancel the trip, the committee launched into a series of crisis calls to determine the most appropriate course of action. With the Union out of hours, Noah sought counsel from the security team who, after a thorough risk assessment, advised the careful removal of the remaining glass and the strategic application of cardboard and tape. The team got to work with a roll of duct tape, and a dream. They pushed out the glass with surgical precision and neatly taped two pieces of MDF (very kindly donated by Tesco) with binbags sandwiched in between them to the window frame (Fig.5,6).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/freshers-trip-2025/images/IMG_3049.webp" width="200"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The freshers looked on in awe, bewildered by the expert craftsmanship unfolding before them, carried out by Imperial’s finest engineers (Fig.7).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/freshers-trip-2025/images/IMG_0894.webp" width="300"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In no time at all (1 and a half hours), the window was as good as new and the all-important food shop was done (Fig.8,9).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/freshers-trip-2025/images/IMG_4083.webp" width="300"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One last obstacle stood between the team and their grand departure. The contact had critically compromised the door latch, now refusing every attempt from the team to close it. With a few delicate and highly technical manoeuvres (a few body slams), the door finally cooperated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-cars"&gt;The Cars
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isaac’s car collected the sleeping mats and Benedict’s car picked up some gear from Westway - where Isaac executed, quite possibly, the worst parallel park job in ICMC history. By 9pm, everyone was back on track and we set off once again - only 3 hours later than anticipated.
Isaac’s car, feeling somewhat left out of the evening’s excitement, soon stumbled upon a scene of modern chivalry and found itself in the crossfire of a Lime bike fireworks jousting battle. Thanks to Isaac’s skilful handling of the car, no was harmed in spite of Gao’s unfortunately opened passenger window. Fortunately, the window repair services of the minibus team were not necessary on this occasion. They made it to the M1 with the help of Kian’s questionable navigation, but just as Wynsee was recounting Isaac’s impressive mid-firework manoeuvring of the car to Peter, Isaac suddenly slammed on the brakes as to not rear-end the car in front. The gap between the two cars shrank alarmingly but by some miracle, no contact was made and a motorway crash was luckily avoided. It was safe to say we then turned down the music a bit to calm the nerves of a slightly frazzled Isaac.
The two cars met up at the Leicester Forest East Service Station to refuel and to allow Kian to stretch out his poor hip flexors. Benedict’s car did not seem to have any incidents to report. Arnav appreciated the peace so much, he had apparently set off into a slumber several times. After an interesting incident in which Isaac’s car seemingly teleported around the car park (a result of Benedict’s boredom due to his rather uneventful drive and Kian’s cruel betrayal), the two cars set off on the final stretch to Rowsley Village Hall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-adblues-"&gt;The AdBlues :(
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The minibus team on the other hand, continued their impressive streak of misfortune. A warning had popped up on the dashboard: the AdBlue needed refilling, or the minibus would not restart after a certain number of miles. Noah promptly purchased and refilled the AdBlue, but the warning persisted. This would have to be an issue for another day, it was getting late and the priority was to get everyone to the village hall. Travelling through the pitch black, the team discovered that the minibus was severely underqualified to tackle the rolling hills of the Peak District – it was in fact, rolling down them, backwards. On several occasions, the team had to go out and push the minibus to help start it - at one point, leaving Arav sprinting after it, leaping aboard while it was still in motion all while nursing his toe fracture (affectionately named Bendi).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The minibus team finally arrived at Rowsley Village Hall at approximately 2:30am and were welcomed by a lovely platter of cakes and desserts from the Library Café. After trialling several sleeping arrangements (Fig.10,11) to compensate for the shortage of sleeping mats and Isaac insisting that he did not need a sleeping bag (he later regretted this), we all nodded off for an early night (3:30am).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/freshers-trip-2025/images/IMG_0904.webp" width="300"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/freshers-trip-2025/images/IMG_1269.webp" width="300"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
Figure 10: Ethan (L) and Jeremy (R) evaluating the chair-based sleeping arrangement. The approach was ultimately discarded, possibly because of its resemblance to Jeremy’s funeral earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/freshers-trip-2025/images/IMG_0899.webp" width="300"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
Figure 11: Ethan trialling the boulder-pad bed. He maintained that this single-pad arrangement was superior to the traditional two-pad configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-1"&gt;Day 1
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group woke up bright and early (8:30am) to the sweet melody of Free Tibet and the kitchen was swiftly filled with the comforting smells of instant coffee and toast (Fig.12). Many members of the trip tried Biscoff spread for the first time. Notably, Ethan ate about half a tub. Wynsee set up a very efficient eyeliner station (Fig.13) and Noah was churning out several mugs of microwaved porridge for the group to enjoy. Before long, we were fuelled up and ready to climb some rocks at The Roaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/freshers-trip-2025/images/IMG_1832.webp" width="300"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
Figure 13: Wynsee applying eyeliner on Benjamin at the highly optimised eyeliner station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the cars had to wait for about an hour at the crag as once again, the minibus demonstrated its incompetency on the hills. Isaac’s car bravely fended off a parking space for the minibus as they desperately tracked its location. They noticed the minibus had stopped in its tracks. Once again, the minibus team had had to push it up the hills (Fig.14) and Arav recreated his dramatic leap (much to the dismay of Bendi).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/freshers-trip-2025/images/freshers%20photo%201.webp" width="300"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
Figure 14: Ethan, Arav, Arush, Olaf, Vasily and Benjamin pushing the minibus up the hills on the way to the crag. Arav running after the minibus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the verge of a breakdown due to the AdBlue issue, the minibus frantically drove past the space that Isaac’s car had defended and found a more accessible parking space – this would turn out to be an unfortunate mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-roaches"&gt;The Roaches
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally at the crag, we got some climbing in! A big group were climbing “Greener Traverse” (f5+) and “The Greener Traverse” (f6b) (Fig.15).

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/freshers-trip-2025/images/IMG_3057.webp" width="300"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
Arush, Mickey, Benedict and Louis tried “Stretch and Mantle” (f6C) and “Undercut Dyno” (f7B) (Fig.16).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/freshers-trip-2025/images/IMG_4269.webp" width="300"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
Figure 16: “Stretch and Mantle” (f6C).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaac, Kian, Shu, Quynh, Mickey and Wynsee found a fun slab to try (Fig.17,18).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/freshers-trip-2025/images/IMG_4254.webp" width="300"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
Figure 17: Isaac standing on basically nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figure 18: Mickey taking a selfie. Kian on the slab with Isaac, Shu and Quynh (L-R) looking on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeremy and Benjamin set up a toprope on “Yong” (HVD 4a) - apparently not very well as later discovered by Isaac (Fig.19).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/freshers-trip-2025/images/IMG_1845.webp" width="300"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
Figure 19: Isaac at the top of “Yong” (HVD 4a), inspecting the anchor and discovering that both carabiners were unlocked and one of the gates were open.
Jeremy and Benjamin also completed “Guano Gully” (S 4b) where some impressive spotting by Jeremy saved Benjamin from a nasty 3m ground fall (Fig.20).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/freshers-trip-2025/images/IMG_8205.webp" width="300"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/freshers-trip-2025/images/IMG_41641.webp" width="300"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
Figure 20: Benjamin at the top of “Guano Gully” (S 4b) relatively unscathed from his 3m fall thanks to Jeremy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaac set up his slackline (Fig.21) and Ethan completed his very first roped climb (Yong on toprope) with the help of Arush and Wynsee singing Gracie Abrams for encouragement (Fig.22). His send was closely followed by sends from Claire, Toby, Oscar and Arnav.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/freshers-trip-2025/images/IMG_4293.webp" width="300"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
Figure 22: Ethan on his first ever roped climb (Yong on toprope)!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ethan had a delicious triple decker bread sandwich (no water) for lunch while spooning Arav to tick off 2 squares from the Fresher’s Trip Bingo (Fig.23,24).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/freshers-trip-2025/images/IMG_4132.webp" width="300"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
Figure 24: The Fresher’s Trip 2025 Bingo. Disappointingly, only 7 challenges were completed this trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Down at the road, the glorified wheelie bin (the minibus) was throwing yet another tantrum. The AdBlue problem that was once deemed an issue for another day had now become a much more pressing issue with the minibus now refusing to start. Noah called a mechanic who confirmed that the minibus would have to get towed back to the village hall (Fig.25).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/freshers-trip-2025/images/IMG_8229.webp" width="300"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
Figure 25: The minibus about to get towed away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless, spirits were still high. With the help of Louis, Benedict completed his first trad lead “Raven Rock Gully” (D) which he affectionately nicknamed “stinky crack” (Fig.26).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/freshers-trip-2025/images/IMG_20251025_180945645_HDR.webp" width="300"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
Figure 26: Benedict after his first trad lead, &amp;ldquo;Raven Rock Gully” (D) aka “stinky crack”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arush, Toby, Oscar, Olaf, Ethan and Vasily went to the upper tier to try some boulders (Fig.27).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/freshers-trip-2025/images/IMG_1851.webp" width="300"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
Figure 27: Some sunset bouldering at the Upper Tier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quynh went on a wander around the crag and at sunset, Vasily, Ethan, Wynsee and Toby walked to a nearby highpoint that overlooked the beautiful scenery (Fig.28,29,30). Oscar, Jonathan, Shu and Claire were getting in their final climbs for the day (Fig .31).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/freshers-trip-2025/images/WhatsApp%20Image%202025-10-26%20at%2023.06.45_7812956e.webp" width="300"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
Figure 31: Oscar, Claire, Shu and Jonathan (L-R) watching someone (Ethan?) on a toprope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sun was rapidly setting and it was home time. With the minibus now broken down, the committee had to improvise another plan to get everyone and all the gear back to the village hall. Noah sent 5 freshers (+ Seamus) off with the mechanic - no committee member required (?!) (they all made it back though) while Isaac ferried another five in his car. The last few people made it down from the crag and Ethan deemed his successful jumpscare Benjamin, Gao and Wynsee worth the rashes he got from the bush he was hiding in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="freshers-dinner-and-initiations"&gt;Fresher’s Dinner and Initiations
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the help of Benedict and a few Ubers, we made it back to the village hall and the freshers began preparing a hearty veggie chilli for dinner (Fig.32). We soon learnt that the minibus had received a delightful £70 parking ticket at The Roaches (Fig.33). Given the circumstances (breaking down), there was not much Noah could have done. The good news was that the freshers had finished cooking a very impressive meal that we enjoyed before the ICMC initiations began (Fig.34).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/freshers-trip-2025/images/IMG_4177.webp" width="300"&gt;

Jeremy and Arush cooked up the all-important Freaky Bru (Fig.35) and we began to set up the stage for the Boulder Pad Wrestling tournament where some very impressive matches ensued (Fig.36).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FINAL: Isaac&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FINAL: Vasily&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
Figure 36: Boulder-pad wrestling in action: Olaf V Jeremy. Seamus diligently spotting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notable matches include Seamus and Jeremy’s in which VAR had to be consulted, Seamus managed to take Jeremy’s sock off less than half a second before Jeremy could return the favour (Fig.37).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/freshers-trip-2025/images/freshers%20photo%206.webp" width="300"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
Figure 37: The audience immensely entertained by Seamus and Jeremy’s incredibly close match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ethan and Wynsee’s match lasted approximately 6 seconds and ended in a concussion after Ethan decided to run straight at me. Unsurprisingly, I flew across the hall and smashed my head into the ground (Fig.38). I would argue this was a DNF as Ethan did not remove my sock, the others maintain this was a KO.
Either way, the lessons learned are: don’t body slam into someone half your weight and wear a helmet if you are going to boulder-pad wrestle Ethan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vasily and Isaac made it to the finals after some upsets knocked out the favourites (Benedict, Seamus and Ethan) (Fig.39). Helmets were adopted for this match after Wynsee’s unfortunate accident. Vasily fought valiantly for the honour of the freshers, but a well-timed tactical manoeuvre from Isaac secured him an early advantage. After a fiercely intense battle, both of Vasily’s socks had been removed (Fig.40) and Isaac emerged victorious as the 2025 Boulder-Pad Wrestling Champion (Fig.41).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ethan, Arav, Louis and Benedict played the sling game while a few others attempted climbing over and under the tables where we saw some impressive sends (Fig.42). The term “The Olaf Method” was coined to describe an awkward and slightly painful head-first beta. Louis completed a very impressive nonsight of 4 consecutive tables, thanks in part to Jeremy accidentally pouring cider into his eyes mid-climb (Fig.43).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The night ended with a leisurely midnight stroll and stargazing around the village (Fig.44). Despite the committee’s strong words of caution, Louis went for a chilly dip in the nearby creek. Jeremy and Arush may or may not have given him one too many mid-climb sips of cider. Louis made it out of the creek, slightly more sober than before (maybe not) and everyone finally headed off to bed an entire hour earlier than the night previous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id="day-2"&gt;Day 2
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Day 2 started very similarly to Day 1. Everyone was awoken by the blasting of Free Tibet, and we headed to the kitchen for coffee, toast and Kian’s porridge. Benjamin found the binbags that he had convinced Wynsee were in the minibus (they were in his bag) and the group got to cleaning up the hall. Louis, Wynsee and Seamus spent about 20 minutes scraping burnt rice and oats off the bottom of the pots (Fig.45) but before long, everything was packed up into the vehicles and we headed off to Froggatt for another day of climbing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/freshers-trip-2025/images/IMG_4244.webp" width="300"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
Figure 45: Louis engaged in the delicate process of oat removal, employing state-of-the-art pot-scraping equipment (spoon).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The minibus had stopped once again as Noah was about to park on the road (Fig.46). Louis stationed himself on the side of the road to direct traffic and the minibus team got out one last time to push. As we began unloading the gear, it started raining and it was getting heavier by the minute. Any hope of climbing was quickly dwindling and yet again, the committee had to improvise another plan. There were talks of going to the pub being thrown around but eventually, we settled on heading to The Foundry Climbing Gym in Sheffield (not beating the plastic princess allegations).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/freshers-trip-2025/images/freshers%20photo%2012.webp" width="300"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
Figure 46: The extensive queue of vehicles that formed behind the minibus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kian’s questionable navigation resulted in Isaac’s car doing several circles around The Foundry Gym before finally finding the entrance and discovering that Kian’s questionable navigation had led their car to The Foundry (weightlifting) Gym and not the climbing gym (Fig.47). After a lunch stop, we all made it to the (climbing) gym (Fig.48). The most notable send from this excursion was Zak’s indoor E3 on toprope! Benjamin discovered that you could not place gear into the cracks and thus lost his pizza bet with Jeremy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="the-double-meat-junction"&gt;The Double Meat Junction
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final stop on this trip would be to Loughborough for the annual ICMC Fresher’s Trip Double Meat Junction tradition. 4 brave ICMC freshers (Oscar, Arnav, Kian and Ethan) took it upon themselves to attempt the formidable challenge of eating two large Meat Junction Pizzas within an hour to write themselves into ICMC history. Isaac, the sole 2024 champion, and indeed the only current champion in ICMC, strategically tapped out on the grounds that he still had about four hours of driving left to do.
Oscar was off to a strong start, finishing one and a half pizzas in just 18 minutes. Ethan was off to an even stronger start, completing the same feat in only 10 minutes - though the rest of his car remained unconvinced by his strategy of leaving the crusts until the end. Arnav polished off his first pizza in 15 minutes and Kian maintained a steady, methodical pace. Conversely, Oscar and Ethan began to slow dramatically, each with half a pizza remaining (Fig.49).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/freshers-trip-2025/images/freshers%20photo%2016.webp" width="300"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
Figure 49: Kian (L) and Ethan (R) during their attempts of The Double Meat Junction. Kian can be seen multitasking as Isaac’s navigator.
Amongst the drama of The Double Meat Junction, the expertly crafted MDF window was beginning to lose its structural integrity. With no more duct tape to secure the MDF, the minibus was at risk of losing its window to the depths of the M1. Leaning a few boulder pads against the window and the hopes and prayers of the 15 passengers would have to suffice to make it back to London (Fig.50).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/freshers-trip-2025/images/IMG_4261.webp" width="300"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
Figure 50: The minibus team reinforcing the structural integrity of the window using bouldering pads.
Back to The Double Meat Junction, Arnav was the first to tap out with five slices still on his plate. Oscar followed shortly after, bowing out with two slices and a handful of neglected crusts (Fig. 51). A valiant effort from both, but with their failure, all remaining hope of victory passed to Isaac’s car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/freshers-trip-2025/images/IMG_1280.webp" width="300"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/freshers-trip-2025/images/freshers%20photo%2014.webp" width="300"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
Figure 51: Oscar’s remaining slices of pizza and Oscar on his deathbed (he didn’t throw up though!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kian had only a couple of slices remaining, while Ethan faced his biggest challenge: the crusts. Time was running out, and both were visibly struggling. Then, as The Final Countdown played triumphantly in the background, Kian completed The Double Meat Junction in an astonishing 47 minutes (Fig.52). A full five minutes faster than Isaac’s 2024 victory, all while navigating! When asked for a victory speech, he could only manage a burp. As if The Double Meat Junction was not difficult enough, Kian then had a few Squares for dessert. A truly impressive showing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/freshers-trip-2025/images/freshers%20photo%2015.webp" width="300"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
Figure 52: Kian on his final pizza slice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ethan, on the other hand, was well and truly against the clock. With only a few minutes remaining, he faced his final obstacle: a handful of the dreaded crusts - the self-proclaimed worst part of any pizza. In the dying seconds of the final minute and The Final Countdown playing in the background once again, Ethan completed The Double Meat Junction in 59 minutes. Upon his nail-biting victory, he offered a few truly motivational words: “Six, seven” (Fig.53).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/freshers-trip-2025/images/freshers%20photo%2016.webp" width="300"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
Figure 53: Ethan (self-proclaimed pizza hater) gracing the fans with his words of wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so, with sore muscles, full stomachs and one fewer minibus window to our name, we returned to London - a little sleepier, a little more brainrotted and a lot more seasoned in the art of surviving an eventful weekend (Fig.54).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/freshers-trip-2025/images/freshers%20photo%2017.webp" width="300"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
Figure 54: The minibus and all its passengers (only 9 photographed here&amp;hellip;?) safely returned to Beit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, a few words of thank you are in order.
Firstly, a huge thank you to everyone one who came on this trip, you all made this a genuinely unforgettable weekend. Your enthusiasm, despite the mishaps and the rain and cold, was truly inspiring. To everyone new to ICMC this year, I hope this trip gave you a taste of what we’re about and an opportunity to try something new! I hope you stick around and come back for more! Thank you, thank you, thank you to Noah, Isaac and Benedict for driving this weekend, this trip simply would not have been possible without you. Noah, you are a legend for dealing with that metal sh*tbox (Fig.55). And finally, massive thank you to the committee for making this trip happen and dealing with issue after issue. It wasn’t the easiest trip to kick off the year, but we got everyone there and back and even managed some climbing along the way, so that’s a W.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="16112024"&gt;16/11/2024
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was still dark on Saturday morning as I arrived at Beit Hall, sleep-deprived but excited for the day ahead
— Portland’s limestone awaited. I was meeting Amy and Sofia before the rest of the group arrived for our
6am departure. Amy was the driver, and Sofia lived next-door so was hitching a ride with her to Beit in the
minibus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Right, well I can’t locate the driver,” Sofia texted me from her flat, with the minibus packed and ready
outside. We soon realised that Amy wasn’t going to wake up any time soon, and because of Amy’s
industrial-strength earplugs, the doorbell wouldn’t suffice. Sofia tried knocking on Amy’s bedroom window
with a broomstick, but it didn’t reach. Thinking quickly, she grabbed the clip-stick from the minibus and while
I kept calling Amy’s phone, Sofia leant out of her own bedroom window and smacked Amy’s window with
the clip-stick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the rest of the climbers slowly gathered at Beit, groggy and cold, with Asha and Luane looking
particularly rough since they had been here, at the student’s union bar, only a few hours earlier.
Finally, Amy texted. Turns out the alarm she was relying on was set for weekdays only. Twenty minutes
later, the minibus arrived with Amy, hair straight out of bed and toothpaste still on her face, apologising
profusely for the mild fiasco. By some miracle, we hit the road at 6.20am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had one quick stop at the services on the way to Portland to freshen up where everyone, now slightly
more awake from their coffees, was able to introduce themselves (we decided it was still too early for a
“Say one fun fact about yourself!” type of icebreaker, so stuck to just names and pronouns).
To maximise daylight hours, we drove straight to the crag carpark. Pads on our backs, we headed down to
Cuttings Boulderfield. Even though it wasn’t my first time taking this approach, the sight of the sea
emerging as you walk beneath the ruins of a castle bridge still took my breath away. We paused for a safety
brief from Asha, as for many of us (me included), it was our first time bouldering outdoors. In hindsight, we
probably should’ve done this where there was a better phone signal, because the next 20 minutes were
spent trying to send screenshots of the topos from Amy’s RockFax to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hit the rocks with a few good hours of daylight left, though, even with Asha’s countless trips here, we
still managed to miss the turn into the boulderfields. I was super proud to top out my first outdoor boulder,
“Hammer Time” (4), considering how terrified I had been. Katy, Amelia, Shuyi and Rafi also conquered their
first outdoor boulders. Some of us had a go at the notoriously difficult mantel on “Pinky Power” (6a/7a
depending on the start), climbing the tree next to try find any holds on the top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the sun dipped below the horizon and the air grew cooler, my heart warmed at the roar of cheers from a
few boulders away. I turned to see Amy topping out on “Smash ‘n’ Grab, sit start” (6b), the problem she’d
been working on all day. Her hands were caked with blood, dirt, and tattered tape, yet a wide smile
stretched across her face, mirrored by the grins of everyone cheering her on. With headlamps on, we
wrapped up the session with some night bouldering, each of us taking a crack at “Global Underground”
(5+), as Rafi finally found the “razor-sharp crimp” we’d all been hunting for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back at the bunkhouse, it was time to make dinner, and I was in charge of making daal. Usually, I would
just eyeball the quantities to make a few portions, so spent way too long trying to figure out how many
lentils were enough for 14 people (I ended up making way too much, but at least we know for next time).
Seven cups of lentils and a few burnt naans later we enjoyed a lovely meal, and I had a newfound respect
for Sofia for all her trip dinners I had taken for granted in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We settled in for a quick board game before bed, but as we were setting up, Shuyi walked in, looking
distraught. She had lost her phone, which had been in her hand just moments before. The group rallied
together to help search for it, and what felt like hours (though it was probably less than one) was spent
combing every corner of the bunkhouse. Asha and Daphné even checked under the toilet seat. In a
moment of desperation, I turned on the tap, half-hoping the phone would magically appear from the pipes.
Finally, Sofia discovered it, hiding deep in the sofa which had already been searched through three times.
With the mystery solved, we all headed to bed, exhausted after a long day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="17112024"&gt;17/11/2024
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;After warm showers and a restful night in actual beds (yes, this was the boujee trip), everyone fuelled up on
overnight oats before heading to Lost Valley for some sport climbing. Nestled in an idyllic valley, it was
completely empty except for us and the robins. We got climbing right away, while Luane, still not recovered
from Friday night, napped on a crashpad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amelia and Felicia crushed their first outdoor lead climbs, while boulderers Ella and Rafi were introduced to
ropes and heights. Sofia was confronted by “Flake Away” (4a), a climb she had NOT enjoyed on her last
visit. Facing her demons, she conquered the climb, and almost everyone managed to snap a cool photo
sitting at the top of the flake. Halfway up “Robin Crack” (5b), I found a creature nestled amongst dirty
cobwebs right where I wanted to use the crack. I freaked out, thinking it was a centipede, and bailed. Sofia
later confirmed it was, in fact, a snail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whilst I was searching for a place to pee, I spotted Amy emerging from the bushes, baby wipes in hand and
looking a little shaken. It seemed last night’s daal hadn’t agreed with her stomach. To make matters worse,
she hadn’t realised her chosen spot was right at the base of a boulder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sofia adored one of the moves on “The Dark End of the Street” (6a+) and encouraged me to try it (it was as
cool as she said). We found a rock with a stunning view of the sea and cliffs, where we soaked in the
vastness between climbs. On the way back to the minibus, the purple sky darkened, and we were treated
to a blazing sunset at the top of the hill where we were parked. Luane decided she hadn’t had enough
climbing and began scaling the minibus to get a better view, with a couple of us spotting her nervously.
We stopped at Codfathers for fish and chips (or, in Asha’s and my case, vegan chili con carne and breaded
mushrooms). Felicia wished she&amp;rsquo;d asked how large the “large cod” was before ordering—it was, in her
words, quite large indeed. Asha and I wished we hadn’t ordered the breaded mushrooms because they
were, in our words, bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the drive home, we reflected on the trip, sharing our two stars and one wish. Many loved how kind,
supportive, and safe the trip felt and wished there were more gender-inclusive events like this (looks like
I’ve got work to do!). Ella was inspired to learn to belay, and Merve was just thankful for the real beds (a
luxury after the usual floor-sleeping on ICMC trips).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was grateful for the fact it didn’t rain once (a rare feat in November) and felt proud to have run my first trip.
It was a full-circle moment, as Asha’s Gender-Inclusive trip last year had been my first time climbing
outdoors, and I couldn’t help but reflect on all the amazing ICMC friends and memories I had made since
then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We arrived at the minibus on Friday evening only to find that it was packed full of a bizarre assortment of items, including no less than 10 incredibly heavy gazebos and multiple in bags of clothes? Off to a great start as we had to unload all of this and dump it in the Union office. Other than that, there were no major dramas other than Amy being in charge of sorting out which trad gear was needed - having no clue she decided to bring everything. Meanwhile, Sofia was in big Tesco, trying to figure out what an appropriate amount of vegan ham was. Goods acquired, we set off on our long long journey to Wye on Valley: travel time, 2.5 hours (minibus speed).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We arrived in the village hall only to discover that it did in fact, have a shower. This was after Sofia explicitly told everyone that it didn’t and that they didn’t need towels. As it had turned out that the club didn’t have enough roll mats, the unlucky few fashioned beds out of chairs and ropes and ended up having a decent night sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next morning Sofia excitedly woke everyone up at 7am proclaiming that the weather forecast said it was dry, before actually looking outside and realising we were in a cloud. Back to bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few hours later, after some overnight oats and caffeination, we set off to find a dry crag. We headed off to Wyndcliff and discovered it did have some dry routes! The top ropers set off to do their first outdoor climbs, the tradders looked for something dry to send, and Amy went straight to the driest route at the crag: “The Arête” 7a+ (obviously).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had a good few hours of climbing in before the rain descended at the exact time that Tom’s weather app said it would. Cat, Marlene, Ruairi, Nik and Maz all did their first outdoor toprope/lead climbs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our close proximity to Bristol meant the natural next step was to go to Bananafingers. We got there shortly before close and the staff were nice enough to stay open a bit longer for us. We left with bank accounts significantly depleted (looking at Marjorie with those E9 trousers ).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in the village hall, Sofia got started on dinner. She’d learnt from previous mistakes and had gone for a simple meal - tomato and sausage pasta. However, as it turned out, simple did not mean quick. As the tomato sauce simmered away, the games began.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Table bouldering didn’t last long, after Sofia’s failed attempt and huge bruise put everyone off (sharp corners = bad bouldering table). Talks of a ceilidh the night before ended up with Cat teaching everyone Strip the Willow - no one can argue that this trip wasn’t a cultural experience. The hall descended into chaos with people being flung around left right and centre - the hallmarks of a good ceilidh. Ruairi brought out his camp councillor skills and got us to play a bunch of games like the 7 year olds that we are. We soon ran out of energy (typical of both children and pensioners) so it was time for film night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bunch of people all drinking Inch’s ciders meant that Amy just drank whenever she came across a can and quickly got drunk. As soon as the climbing films started she was fast asleep. After simmering for hours and hours, the tomato sauce was FINALLY ready at like 10pm but somehow Merve missed out when the pack descended on dinner so Chef Marjorie quickly whipped up another batch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day we were met with beautiful sunshine. We decided to split the group - Amy and Sofia taking the sport climbers to Cheddar Gorge and Elliot leading the charge with the hardcore trad climbers, off to explore hard climbs in Goblin Combe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We probably should’ve turned round as soon as we crossed the bridge into England and were met with heavy mist… Lesson learnt: the weather at the crag might not be the same as at the accom 😬&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sport climbers arrived at Cheddar Gorge to the sight of flood water being drained from the cave. The entire crag was sopping wet with zero chance of drying. :( The trad boys didn’t fare any better - even the cave was wet. After some deliberation, we decided to leave Cheddar Gorge and its cheddar cheese ice cream (?) and head back to Wales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The boys decided to call it quits and head to Reading Parthian climbing centre to get some guaranteed dry climbing. Trad team: 0; UK weather: 1. At least the Parthian proved to be a fantastic centre and they had a great afternoon trying out boulders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sport climbers somehow struck luck on arrival at Wintour’s Leap, where it was lovely and sunny. However, as no one had been to Wintour’s Leap before, Sherpa Sofia led the sheep down the horrendously muddy and slippy long approach that is NOT the quickest way to the sport crag. This involved 45 mins of slipping and stomping through the mud downhill, uphill and through a bog. Amy’s freshly washed 70m long poo rope (another long story) did not survive the journey unscathed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shockingly when we arrived at the crag, the rock was surprisingly dry given just how much rain had fallen the night before. Everyone managed to get a couple of climbs in. The quarry proved reliably chossy, and Marlene caught a huge rock headed straight for Lucas’s head (somehow this moment was captured on film).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty much everyone tried their hand at the world’s hardest 6a+. Once Amy tried and failed we concluded that there must have been a broken off hold - UKC comments agree. Sofia and Amy went to tackle what they thought was a breezy 25m 6a+. Despite not finding it all that simple, Amy gaslit Sofia into thinking she was seriously struggling with “it’s not even a bad 6a+”. Further consultation of UKC determined it was a new route, 6b/+ 😵‍💫&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had a beautiful sunset and group photo at the top of the crag (fans of Sex Education might recognise). We discovered there was a much easier way to access the crag 🫠 Luckily for all but Amy, this meant that the group was far from the minibus so they got to go chill in the pub whilst the minibus was retrieved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The night sky was beautiful, and we spent an hour drinking our pints and stargazing. Marlene and Sofia were pointing out constellations and satellites, and Maz was overwhelmed with the beauty and the vastness of the cosmos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, a very good trip despite the weather.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="trip-report"&gt;Trip Report
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The absolutely epic ICMC Women &amp;amp; Gender Inclusive trip went ahead to the Isle of Portland in November!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter the level of experience, all were welcome, so as you can imagine the vibes were impeccable with some people excited to outdoor climb for the first time and others returning to crush their projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A special thanks to Rockfax for giving us access to their guidebook for the start of the year and Tenzing for the high energy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="highlights"&gt;Highlights
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asha’s Two Stars:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being rescued by Amy and Sofia’s 10/10 trad anchor at the top of Neddyfield’s in the dark after my locking carabiner wouldn’t unlock!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The sunset at the New Cuttings boulderfield with the bouldering gang, getting addicted to The Slide 7B, then trying to find our way back in the dark!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maz’s Two Stars:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The sound of waves crashing behind us whilst we were climbing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The overnight oats and chugging oatmilk before the drive back&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yujiao’s Two Stars:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watching the view of the sea while resting on the wall&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Completing the 500 pieces puzzle with Justine when everyone else went sleeping&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lauren’s Two Stars:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Getting to experience how beautiful Portland is - Getting to the top of the route and turning around to take in the sea view was incredible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My first outdoor lead!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id="climbs-ticked"&gt;Climbs Ticked
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Too many to keep track! We went to Neddyfields and Cuttings for some gorgeous sport climbing. Here are a few climbs we loved at Neddyfields:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I Wish I Was in Steve’s Shoes 5c&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Felix Navidad 6a+&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Infelicity 6a&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Milly Vanilly 6a&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boulders Ticked:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Terminator 7a&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dickhead Plumber 7a&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thanks for the Cash 6b+&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hung Out to Dry 5+&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SuperNova 3&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2 id="background"&gt;Background
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id="history"&gt;History
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Climbing in Bosnia &amp;amp; Herzegovina is a new pastime, with all of the routes being developed since the millennium and most in the last 10 years. It is a region full of beautiful unclimbed rock and stunning scenery. Very few locals climb, this hampers the growth of the sport as there are very few people who have the skills to develop climbing areas and inspire people to take up the sport. In 2015 the Extreme Club in Banja Luka created the ‘Drill &amp;amp; Chill’ Festival. This sought to bring experienced climbers and highliners from all over the world to the region to develop new climbing routes and to celebrate the unique culture within the sport. Since then it has grown from strength to strength, and is responsible for the development of over 350+ new routes. The festival is located in the beautiful Canyon Tijesno on the outskirts of Banja Luka. It contains some of the region’s finest climbs, with sport routes ranging from easy 5+, to a near impossible 9a as well as a range of adventurous multipitches. The canyon is also ideally suited for highlines, ranging from 35m in length to a regional record breaking 705m line. As well as the climbing the festival has a range of workshops, ranging from juggling and traditional embroidery to acro-yoga and aerial silk. The festival also runs a free bolting course, teaching competent climbers how to develop and bolt new routes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="objectives"&gt;Objectives
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team was keen to experience the beautiful scenery and climbing the region has to offer as well as contribute to the development of the sport in the region. Developing crags and bolting your own route is something that is near impossible in the UK as the climbing scene is very mature and potential sites saturated. Some team members were psyched on creating their own route and developing the local scene, others wanted to push themselves on highlines and all were keen on enjoying the delights of Bosnian limestone. A few wanted to progress into multipitch climbing. Some just wanted to chill after a stressful summer of high frequency trading at one of the city’s top cream sucking firms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="tour-overview"&gt;Tour Overview
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id="day-0"&gt;Day 0
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alisha and Tim were keen beans and flew out a day ahead of the main crowd, most of whom were working on Friday. The extortionate cost of roaming data meant their trail went cold shortly after crossing the border into Bosnia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="day-1"&gt;Day 1
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main pack congregated at Liverpool Street for an early train out to Stanstead. Will and Elliot managed to blag a lift from relatives and so missed out on the egg &amp;amp; bacon breakfast McMuffin. After clearing security, the group stopped off for some light refreshments. Boarding the plane was hairy as some members of the group had come up with creative ways of maximising their hand luggage allowances, much to the dismay of the Ryanair staff. After a short argument Will had managed to convince them that a helmet was an item of clothing, and his roll mat was simply a blanket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/drill-and-chill-summer-tour-2022/image1.jpg" width="200"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two uneventful hours later we landed in Zagreb. After getting confused by local taxis we made it to the bus stop. George put his incredibly poor Croatian language skills to use and convinced the bus driver that we had 7 tickets through some broken Czech and vigorous hand gestures. We boarded and headed off towards the border. The 8 Bosnians on the bus promptly started smoking creating a veiling haze and giving most members a migrane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We arrived in Banja Luka a few hours later and stocked up on provisions for the week. We got lucky and managed to stumble upon the only taxi driver in Banja Luka who also climbed and happened to know where the festival was. 40 minutes later we were cruising down the dirt road to the festival site. Upon arrival the group was pleased to find Alisha and Tim, both alive and well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="day-2"&gt;Day 2
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group were psyched to get going. Jake was starting to panic as we hadn’t found any gas for our stove the day before. Will attended the bolting course theory session. 2 hours of PowerPoint presentations later he worked out bolting was a lot of effort and promptly decided that 5 days of manual labour was not the optimal way to spend a tour. So much for developing the local climbing scene. At least his trad climbing ethical standards are still intact. Jake and George went off to charm a fellow festival attendee into boiling some water for a brew. Upon the first sip of the coffee Jake realised we had bought the most disgusting beans possible, but soldiered on for his caffeine fix, rubbing the remaining grounds into his gums to little added effect. After this it was discovered the camp had a Snack-bar run by Vito, a local legend, who served coffee at reasonable prices. Jake had never been happier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group spent the rest of the morning day getting acquainted with the site, visiting all the crags and highline spots. Sector ‘Amfiteatar’ proved to be the most inspiring with its stunning setting and steep overhanging walls. Sadly grades started at 6c+ and topped out at Interklemezzo - 9a a route bolted by Adam Ondra, the team decided some warm up routes were needed. After lunch a contingent headed out to sector Vito, where Liam, James, Will and Elliot enjoyed the pleasant at the grade ‘Living La Vito Loca’ – 6a and the slightly chossy ‘One hand minus’ – 5b.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/drill-and-chill-summer-tour-2022/image2.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tim enjoyed soaking up the chilled atmosphere and continued to make friends with the other festival goers at the camp. George, Jake, Alisha and Victor and ventured out to the 35m highline to test their mettle. Each taking turns to roll out into the middle of the line and soak up the exposure. Jake was mesmerised by the 200m of open air below him, so much so he decided climbing was actually a rubbish sport and he was going to become a highliner instead. George, who had previous highline experience was reminded how painful sitting on the 1” webbing was, especially for the duration of time it took to compose himself before attempting to stand up. He never stood a chance and fell straight off. This would become a recurring theme throughout the week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/drill-and-chill-summer-tour-2022/image3.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team congregated for dinner, refreshed from the previous days travel and thoroughly psyched for the week ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="day-3"&gt;Day 3
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Day 3 started with the team attending a functional breathing workshop. Tim, Alisha, Victor and especially Will getting invested in the practice. George and Jake were finding it hard to keep a straight face as the coach explained the kidneys stored all the soul’s trauma, over the sound of 50 hyperventilating climbers. They made a B-Line for Vito’s to get their morning caffeine fix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/drill-and-chill-summer-tour-2022/image4.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James, Will, Victor, Elliot and Alisha headed out to sector Krilo and finally found some rock that was more secure. Some highlights of the day include ‘Paprika’ – 5c which all the team managed to tick, whilst strong James eased back in after an injury by climbing ‘Dirty Dan’ – 6B which was then repeated by Victor and Will. Over at the highlines, George, Jake and Liam were making progress towards their goal of standing up. This involved a lot of falling followed by an equal amount of shouting. The Trio decided to mask their inadequacy and build their confidence by hanging upside-down from the lines instead of walking them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/drill-and-chill-summer-tour-2022/image5.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After regrouping at dinner, the team prepared themselves for a big night: the drill and chill Triathlon. This team event involved a timed race across 3 disciplines: rope coiling, 10 pullups and drinking a beer whilst on a slackline. Sadly we did not make it out of the selection phase and were forced to watch from the side-lines. The team quickly forgot this disappointment and started enjoying the rest of the evening. To add to the misery, DJ Baba Djex was unable to make it and instead we were treated to a evening of Jawharp music. This was complemented nicely by a substantial quantity of local brandy known as ‘Rakia’. Jake and Elliot seemed to lose themselves in the tribal tones as the team danced the evening away. Tim’s networking earlier in the week paid dividends as he was offered a shot on the stage playing a jaw harp. He did the team proud, and despite not attracting the attention of any record labels on his debut, he held his own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/drill-and-chill-summer-tour-2022/image6.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="day-4"&gt;Day 4
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nursing a slight headache from the day before, the team decided to make the most of the workshops on offer and take a rest day. After two visits to Vito’s Jake was just about feeling human again and the pack headed to the forest chill zone. Here a large space net was found, and the team proceeded to do very little for the next few hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/drill-and-chill-summer-tour-2022/image7.jpg" width="400"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first workshop of the day was in the art of Aerial Silk acrobatics. The team took to this like ducks to water. After a few pointers, Will was able to string together a series of moves, taking in two elegant poses whilst fully embracing his inner swan. He swiftly forgot the details for the subsequent move and ended tying himself in a knot on the floor and in need of a rescue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/drill-and-chill-summer-tour-2022/image8.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group then ventured to the highlines in an attempt to do something with the day. Victor and Tim made their maiden voyage out onto the lines, whilst Liam struck up a conversation with some people playing the guitar. Tim later leveraged his newfound musical reputation to form a band with them, and they promptly released their first single “like a butterfly”. This went down a treat, with the rest of the highliners joining in for the chorus. Rumor has it their EP drops in early December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That evening a classic Bosnian film was shown in camp. It covered the trials and tribulations of two pioneering Bosnian hip-hop artists as they navigated their way through failed relationships to fame in Yugoslavia. Whilst not suitable for the British cinema industry, it didn’t stop a few team members from having a good chuckle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/drill-and-chill-summer-tour-2022/image9.jpg" width="200"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="day-5"&gt;Day 5
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The objective of the day was to climb a route bolted by George the year prior, ‘Crack and forth’ – 6a+. The team headed out to sector Jazbina, only to find the sector shut and the bolting course attendees hanging 30m above our heads. A swift retreat to sector Vito followed. George, Victor and Alisha enjoyed excursions up the delighful ‘Veni, Vidi, Vito’ – 6a and the less delightful ‘Livin la vito loca’ – 6a+. Will, James and Liam kept themselves occupied and tackled the more difficult ‘Einfach Tapfer Sein’ – 6b. Jake and Elliot had a hairy experience on ‘Illatos Olomos’- 4+ which seemed to have more trees than a medium sized arboretum. This killed their psyche for the day and they headed back to camp to further develop their aerial silk skills. George and Victor later tried to repeat Einfach Tapfer Sein but to little success. The team returned to camp and enjoyed a traditional local cabbage soup dinner with accompanying burek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/drill-and-chill-summer-tour-2022/image10.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="day-6"&gt;Day 6
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team was full of psyche on the last full day. With reports of bad weather brewing in the afternoon they set off early to make the most of the day. Shortly after setting off the wind and rain rolled in. The window in Will and James’ tent decided it was the perfect opportunity to detach itself, leaving an 8” hole for the menacing rain. As any self-respecting engineer would do, George decided the obvious answer was duct tape and a Sainsburys bag. 10 minutes later the tent was good as new, Will initially doubted the repairs integrity, however preferred this to the porta-loo alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/drill-and-chill-summer-tour-2022/image11.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully the rain packed quickly, and after a few hours of drying we headed out back to the rock. Victor took the opportunity to take climbing barbie to new heights on ‘Honeymoon Suite’ - 6a, whilst George got to the top of the route he bolted the year before ‘Crack and Forth’. The send train was then left the station with Will, Victor, Liam and James also ticking the route. Jake pushed himself and ticked ‘Toxic MascuGINity’ – 5c as did Elliot shortly after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/drill-and-chill-summer-tour-2022/image12.jpg"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pack then headed to Sector Amfiteatar for the afternoon. Will was keen to try something hard and hoped on ‘Hustensaft’ – 6c+, which he onsighted, but not without a few expletives. Strong James not to be outdone, then repeated the route. George and Victor raced up ‘Good boy’ – 6b. George, Jake, Liam and Tim had one more go on the highlines and failed to make any significant progress. Before they could get a second attempt the wind picked up and the lines started oscillating, they figured it was safer to retreat to the camp and get a beer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the weather the goodbye party was moved a day earlier, and the team took full advantage. After getting bored of the light show, Elliot embraced his inner ‘Mr Badcock’ and put his PGCE to good use by organising a festival wide game of hide and seek. None of the team got lost and we quickly congregated around the slacklines to attempt some night slacking. This was unsuccessful, with most of the team making fools of themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="day-7"&gt;Day 7
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team awoke to it chucking it down. It was clear nothing was going to climbed that day, and packed the tents down in misery. We then said our goodbyes and left the festival site. Tim decided to cancel his flight and venture onwards to a Hungarian Jawharp festival with his new friends Bruno, Dan and Sophie. The remainder of the pack got back on the early bus to Zagreb. We stashed our bags at the station and decided to explore what Zagreb had to offer. After finding the main cathedral was under repair, Liam and James decided to flip a coin at each junction they encountered to explore the less visited parts of the city. The remainder of the pack ventured to a park, where Elliot climbed the final route of the trip ‘Playground’ - 7c+, then decided we needed to find a pub. Luckily James and Liam’s coin had a similar idea, and the group congregated to reminisce about the tour. We then headed to Zagreb airport and found a comfortable corner to setup camp for the night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/drill-and-chill-summer-tour-2022/image13.jpg" width="250"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="day-8"&gt;Day 8
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the sound of ‘please do not leave your baggage unattended’ being blared over the tannoy every 15 minutes, it’s safe to say the team did not find themselves well rested in the morning. After boarding the flight most passed out to recoup the lost sleep. We landed in London and went our separate ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Footnote:&lt;/strong&gt;
After a further 10 days cruising around Europe with his new friends, Tim safely returned to London to continue his geology degree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="conclusion--lessons-learnt"&gt;Conclusion &amp;amp; Lessons Learnt
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the tour was a massive success. Everyone had pushed themselves either through climbing or highlining. The team developed new skills in the art of aerial silk, embroidery, juggling, acro-yoga and music. Liam returned more chilled than ever before and ready to suck some more cream. Most importantly, the team were all exposed to opportunities they would not have had within the UK. The outdoor climbing experience of group members was significantly improved, and all were exposed to highlining for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite all the things achieved, we did not completely fulfil our aims. Many had wanted to climb some multi-pitch routes. The multipitch routes in the canyon rarely get climbed, leading to lots of vegetation growing in the holds, and the routes remaining ‘dirty’. This makes them much harder than the grade indicated. They are also quite committing with an abseil in approach meaning the route needs to be climbed in full to get back to the camp. The team all displayed sound judgement and adapted their aims to ones that could be achieved safely, an attitude that is a credit to them. I would recommend all future tour leaders to not be afraid of changing plans based on the conditions you find on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="future-development"&gt;Future Development
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a strong desire within the club to do more highlining. Since returning we have acquired a slackline for the club so members can develop these skills in London. Building on this another tour to a highline venue could be a possibility in the years going forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="report"&gt;Report
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first trip of 2022 marked the ICMC’s first return to the Isle of Portland, Dorset since 2018. A lack of cheap accommodation (or motivation for camping) brought any previous plans to a standstill. This was changed by Vice-Pres George, who went above the call of duty by randomly dialling phone numbers in the Dorset region until he found a church hall for hire under the house of a vicar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/portland-trip-report-2022/image2.png"

&lt;p&gt;Miguel making a barefoot crack ascent of Chalkie and the Hex 5 (5a) &amp;lsquo;for fun&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few messages later and members rushed to buy tickets for what promised to be a cracking weekend of sport and bouldering. President Ollie Tippett gravely missed access to the union minibuses after his own van broke down before getting out of his driveway. Although he missed the trip he was there in spirit, as all present could feel his sarcastic comments like some form of undiagnosed PTSD. The remaining members made their way to the Isle in good order, and George rapidly organised the hire of bouldering pads to replace those lost in Ollie’s van.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/portland-trip-report-2022/image1.png"
alt="Liam repeating the bare-footed ascent." width="500"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liam repeating the bare-footed ascent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following a reasonable night’s sleep (one unidentified snorer must have slept well!), the club rose to start a solid day’s climb in the cuttings. Whilst Ciaran and George headed off to fetch the hire pads, the rest of the trip warmed up on some of the easier sport routes offered in the cuttings and revised some anchor-rethreading theory. Upon their return with said pads, some boulderers (who shall not be named) (Callum) declared sport climbing to be a fruitless endeavour, and led a group down to the Cuttings boulder field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/portland-trip-report-2022/image3.png" width="500"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The boulderers had a strong day, with Asha, Callum and Jake (minus one foot) sending Anasazi Lost (7A), Callum sending Lightning Strike (7A+), and Asha and Jake sanding their hands down on Relativity (7A) to no avail. A larger group joined them from the upper cliffs to send Days of Colour (6A).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sport climbers moved on from the warmup to tackle various harder routes, namely Too Many Cooks (6b), Mousefolk (6c), Evening Mistress (6b). Rory made quick work of the Mermaid (7a), encouraging many others to follow suit (with more beta and fewer attempts; Will). Scarlett and Daisy worked their way around increasingly bold routes around the crag, culminating in a plan to multi-pitch some routes in the Bower buttress (see later on). Mellisa and Anaya taped up and worked their way up and down the Jam (4c offwidth), seemingly in search of the perfect jamming technique. Max and Mathilde surprised everyone by admitting they had yet to climb outdoors; following a tutoring session with George they went on their merry way and worked their way up the grades on offer around the crag. Will (belayed by Liam) worked on their fall/fall catching practice by working on Mousefolk (6c) and Perihelion (6b+). Despite a skin-sanding fall on the slabby layback of Mousefolk and a complete inverted ragdoll-like swing after the crux of Perihelion, Will walked away unharmed with an added trust in Liam’s belaying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rory, Miguel and Ciaran psyched each other up to try out Modern Nightmare (7a), a long (for the cuttings) route split into a stiff bouldery start, a taxing section up a groove and a set of 3 roofs with blind jugs. After figuring out the beta for the boulder (and most importantly realising the first bolt can be pre-clipped with a little jump!), all 3 were shut down by the roofs of the route which proved tricky to read (who would have guessed…).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The club made their way back to the vicar’s house for atonements (i.e well earned rests). George expertly directed the kitchen, delivering two excellent chillis (vegi &amp;amp; meat) and impressively heterogenous rice, albeit a power cut to the cooker did almost cause havoc if not for his quick thinking (which will not be described here!). Liam decided the ICMC should instead be the Imperial College Melee Club, and demanded the right to wrestle Miguel in exchange for doing his fair share of the washing up. Pots were washed, crash pads were tesselated and Miguel promptly spent 15 minutes in various headlocks before Liam caught his breath and ended up in an armbar. Excited by the atmosphere, Ciaran and Callum had their own match, which Callum later describes as: “an experience. Interesting.” (interpret this as you wish). After a drawn-out match between Ciaran and Miguel which ended with some sore finger tendons, Liam decided a champion had to be declared and challenged Ciaran to a final match. After a near-instant headlock, the ICMC returned to being a climbing club and Liam put his ambitions to rest (until the next trip!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another uneventful night’s sleep passed, Ciaran awoke with a slightly bruised nose (on account of Liam’s heels, see picture above) and Miguel’s neck was reduced to 2 axes of motion. Nevertheless, the club got out of the hall and back to the cuttings for another day of hard sends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The boulderers returned to the coast and were joined by a majority of the trip. Highlights of the day include Callum trying Frankenstein (7C) and almost ticking Liquid Sun (7A+) with Asha. Anaya, Melissa, Liam, George, Max, Mathilde, Melissa, Liam and George all joined to send a long series of 5+s and a few first 6As.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a quick multi-pitch in the Bower (Voices in the Bower, 3 pitch 5a), Rory and Miguel headed to the New Cuttings for a final warm up(Flowers on a Razor Wire 6c), Rory and Miguel before joining Ciaran to return to the Modern Nightmare. Rory disappeared to coach Scarlett and Daisy up the multi-pitch, lying down on top of the crag with his head yelling instructions and inspecting the rope work below with a hawkish gaze. Ciaran took a first stab at Modern Nightmare and almost set the route but fell short at the final roof. Miguel had more luck, sending his 2nd 7a and leaving all of Ciaran’s quickdraws in place as a motivation for his own attempt. However, this was not to be, as multiple attempts to cruise past the opening boulder ended in disappointment for Ciaran. Rory was called upon, but he too was felled by the boulder section despite valiant efforts, leaving Miguel to scream his way back up with ripped hands and retrieve the gear left on route before night fell. All was clear and everyone was safely back on solid ground as the sun began to set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a little convincing, a few members headed down to a nearby cove for an improvised dip in the sea. Perhaps we felt better for doing it, but maybe that was just the hypothermia setting in. It may have been lucky that night time was falling as swim wear was sparse and the rest of the club was gathering at the top of the cliff to depart, but no comments were exchanged or needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="aims-and-objectives"&gt;Aims and objectives
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To pull hard on the amazing rock climbs in the valleys
surrounding Chulilla; a very popular, new climbing
area in southern Spain. Many of the members had
never climbed outdoors before so another aim was to
teach them how to safely operate ropes and deal with
the situations that arise from climbing outdoors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-1"&gt;Day 1
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a crazily early start (or all-nighter in the case of
the members returning from the peak district trip) to
catch the 7:30 flight to Valencia, the group managed
to pull together enough psych to go and climb on the
roadside crags in Chulilla. This gave the perfect taste
of the week ahead, lovely limestone climbs, well
bolted routes, and lots of laughter. A trip to the shops
for cheap Spanish wine was undertaken. Food was
also found, and the group enjoyed a warm evening
inside before heading to bed early.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-2"&gt;Day 2
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a breakfast of porridge (described as the
most meagre portion of porridge ever by one
member) the group headed to the crag. A nice
morning in the shade was had, teaching people
all of the key safety aspects of route cleaning
and other such fun. Alex and Richard went off
to climb a simple multipitch in the afternoon
whilst the rest of the group climbed some
more on the shorter walls before enjoying the
cooling river and a slackline session. Alex and
Richard were having way more fun as they had
decided abseiling was lame, and they would
walk off the top of their route. 3 hours later
and an abseil through a bramble bush they get
back onto the path, dehydrated and
knackered. An enjoyable meal and bonding
session was had in the evening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-3"&gt;Day 3
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;REST DayYYYY. The group headed to a different sector and
had a nice morning of easy climbing to cure their
hangovers. Lunch was had at an incredible swimming area
with beautiful limestone caves hiding behind the
waterfalls. The group then decided clothes were lame and
posed for a centre fold picture. Some preceded to stay
naked for a lot longer than was necessary. Supplies were
gathered for another night and the group had an
incredible BBQ before building a fire and spending the
evening outside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-4"&gt;Day 4
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A day jam packed with crushing, single and multi-pitch
climbing along with some idiocy from the future president.
Everyone was feeling refreshed and full of psych. Two groups headed off to try some multi pitch
early in the morning. Richard and Hannah flew up their route whilst Charlotte and Shan dawdled up
theirs. Everyone else climbed at a new crag, got very hot and then left in search of food. The group
reassembled for lunch and then Alex, Stuart and Richard headed off to try something hard in the
Sex-Shop sector. The aptly named Eco-Dildo was the route of choice and the three guys stayed late
trying for the send. Richard was a moron and didn’t take any quickdraws with him so downclimbed
the crux on his flash attempt before coming down screaming. Stuart then crushed and flashed a
grade he’d never climbed before (what a wad). Alex was weak. Everyone reconvened at the house
for a delicious Bolognese.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-5"&gt;Day 5
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was the last day of climbing for the group; people were sad and exhausted. This didn’t stop them
though. Stuart crushed again; flashing another 7a. Everyone pulled hard on routes and could be
proud of what they achieved across the week. An early dinner of stir fry was had before another fire
and more wine was enjoyed. Some youths were staying next door and at 4am Mert went full dad
mode and told them to shut off the music. He also made the group sandwiches, which were
incredible and well needed at the airport the following morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-6"&gt;Day 6
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glassy eyed and a bit broken the group arose at 6am to travel home. At the airport the group
wallowed in self-pity but no regrets at Burger King before boarding the flight back to London.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-1"&gt;Day 1
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everybody arrived on time in Beit Quad at 6 am ready to finish packing the busses and set off. Harry turned out to be a little worse for wear and had forgotten his passport. After a quick call to his dad it was agreed that the two busses and the car would rendezvous at the ferry terminal ready for the morning crossing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One bus arrived earlier, crossed on its own, both busses and the car all got lost independently and took different routes around Paris. We eventually ended up at Pres Camping south of Fountainbleu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-2"&gt;Day 2
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We got up early and had eggy bread, then headed over to boulder for the day. It was very hot and sunny, a slack line was set off and a few of us played boules while we enjoyed lunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This day involved hundreds and hundreds of miles of driving. Luckily there were loads of drivers and we had lots of food. At one point Jo stopped wearing trousers and decided that the heated seats in the car were all a bit much. Late in the evening the red bus was hit by an oncoming van which destroyed the wing mirror, and the passenger side window. Thankfully nobody was hurt, though there was a lot of glass everywhere. A nearby irrigation system ensured that everybody in the windowless van stayed refreshed, which was great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We arrived in Palud Sur Verdon at around 11:30 pm and found the road leading up to the valley a bit exciting; the enormous drop to the right of the driver and sharp bends made sure that everybody was still awake. We arrived at the wrong campsite and put up the tents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-4"&gt;Day 4
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After waking up and realising that the campsite was wrong and rubbish, we de-camped and headed into town to try and find where we were meant to go. We immediately found Jean- Paul camping and headed over to pop the tents up. We then went to one of the shorter and supposedly more accessible crags in the area. After an hour of swearing and bashing through shrubs we arrived and got a decent afternoons climbing in, introducing the novices in the group to the techniques they’d need over the coming week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-5"&gt;Day 5
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We headed over to a multi-pitch crag that didn’t involve any abseiling to give people some experience of the rope work before we committed to bigger routes. In the afternoon we headed down to the river for a swim!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-6"&gt;Day 6
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We knew that if we wanted to get anything big done while we were there we’d have to get used to the exposure presented by the enormous cliffs. To do this we spent the next day at one of the many abseil points at the edge of the road. Lots of tourists were taking our photos!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/summer-tour-2014-verdon-gorge/images/5.jpg" width="300"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-7-8--9"&gt;Day 7, 8 &amp;amp; 9
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having taught people what they needed to know we split into three’s and took a series of groups to different multipitch crags over the next three days. The routes ranged from enormous crack and chimney climbs to interesting arête’s. Notably Ben and Amar tackled La Demande, one of the more famous routes in the area. Groups that didn’t do multipitch routes headed to abseil points along the roadside or along the valley to the extremely impressive Hulk area; a large scoop/ cave with some really interesting and challenging single pitch climbs. Handily it also stayed dry when the rest of the area was wet!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-10"&gt;Day 10
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a tiring few days we headed down to the river to wind down for a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/summer-tour-2014-verdon-gorge/images/9.jpg" width="400"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/summer-tour-2014-verdon-gorge/images/10.jpg" width="400"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-11"&gt;Day 11
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group went over to the Hulk area because of poor weather. The crag is in the middle of a series of ladders and narrow paths which allows for pretty big exposure in relative safety. On the opposite side of the valley a few people experienced the total darkness of the 1.5km long tunnel which runs along the river. Milan and Anthony got a bit stuck on their route so Ben and Amar shot up an adjacent route to help them out after their abseil line got stuck after they completed their route. Everybody got down in time for a late dinner though Milan and Anthony owed a lot of people a lot of drinks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-12"&gt;Day 12
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the final day in Verdon the weather turned for the worse, those who hadn’t yet done it had a go at the via–ferrata which was about the only thing that was safe to do in the weather. The rest of the group had a relaxing day at the campsite and sorted the mountains of equipment out! The trip was rounded off with a meal at the local restaurant in Palud Sur Verdon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-13"&gt;Day 13
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We left Verdon and headed north making the campsite just south of Paris by 10 pm. Chilli was cooked hastily while a fire was built. Lunch and snack stops were spent at some of the many roadside picnicking areas that the cover much of the French road network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-14"&gt;Day 14
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a quick stop at the wine shop we caught the ferry home and remarked on how great cat-eyes were in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Easter tour 2014 - Geyikbayırı (Turkey)</title><link>YAYAYA/p/easter-tour-2014-geyikbay%C4%B1r%C4%B1-turkey/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Mar 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>YAYAYA/p/easter-tour-2014-geyikbay%C4%B1r%C4%B1-turkey/</guid><description>&lt;img src="YAYAYA/YAYAYA/p/easter-tour-2014-geyikbay%C4%B1r%C4%B1-turkey/cover.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Easter tour 2014 - Geyikbayırı (Turkey)" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sunday 30th March to Thursday the 10th April&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="30th-march"&gt;30th March
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rushes are made through the airport as some people accidentally got on guided tours of south
London instead of the easy bus to Stansted. Everyone makes it on the plane after some luggage is
moved around to make the weights fit. Once in Antalya we meet the driver set to take us to our
campsite. We arrive too late for dinner and in conditions too dark to see how close the cliffs are.
People eat and find their way to their tent rooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="31-st-march"&gt;31 st March
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teaching day. We head to an easy, short section of the cliffs, trekking through the undergrowth for
approximately 30 seconds having left the campsite. People realise that climbing outside is more
difficult when you can’t see where all the holds are. In the afternoon people travel into the nearest
village to buy supply’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="1st-april"&gt;1st April
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Happy that most of the fresher’s can lead we head to the other
end of the cliff where there climbing is more varied. Here we
watch over the novices to make sure everything goes to plan
but also have an opportunity to push for some harder grades
with Neo climbing a 6b. We retire to the campsite to cook
dinner and drink beers and soft drinks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="2nd-april"&gt;2nd April
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We head for the main sector. The larger cliff boasts some of the
more impressive routes of the area, including Barbarossa, a
secret climb found only by those who know where it is. Almost
everyone climbs this bizarre route which ends with a section of
caving out onto the face of the cliff.
People greatly enjoy this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="3rd-april"&gt;3rd April
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rest for some as a group take some of the local street dogs on a walk up
to some ancient ruins. En route they find a tortoise. His name Is Pete.
Pete the tortoise. They put him back and continue walking the dogs until
they can hardly hear the screams of people falling off their projects,
safely. Others refuse to rest and continue climbing until they run out of
finger skin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="4th-april"&gt;4th April
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Project day. Everyone is happy that they can climb in groups by
themselves and as a result people break away and head to climb
whatever they want, all within minutes’ walk of the campsite. These people try harder routes that they can’t climb at first, some of them even fall off without shouting
‘take’. This is good. Jamie finds a 7b, Will looks for a 7a and others continue climbing in new sectors,
gaining experience all the while. More people head into town to buy more supplies. Laura’s ability to
speak Turkish has now become a vital part of tour logistics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="5th-april"&gt;5th April
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;More projects, people spend the morning heading to projects or
going off to explore the small amount of multi pitching available in
the area. Ben finds a 7b+ project, defiantly not chosen as it was
behind his tent and within applauding range of the campsite. So
modest. In the afternoon a sectret crag is found where the floor
seems to be entirely made of sheep poo. This turns out to be
correct. Unfortunately this can’t make up for the difficult nature of
the climbing there so people head back out through the trap door
to the crag and back down the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="6th-april"&gt;6th April
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone decides to head into the village to experience the local
market and grab some grub authentic grub for lunch. We have a
race into town which is won by Jamie and Ben. They celebrate by
drinking beer and soft drinks. Will arrives in a lorry and the others
soon appear. Most of the group manage to avoid buying fake beats headphones and make it to the
food end of the market. What a delight, Turkish delight that is. Gifts are bought for loved and liked
ones out of a sense of duty and people head to a little hut to eat Gözlemes. They are tasty, savoury,
pancake-like naan bread things with stuff in them, and they are cheap. Full of fillings people make
their way back to the campsite and some even do some climbing. Ben sends his project, no one
cares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7th-april"&gt;7th April
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fun day to Olympos. Two cars are rented and driven to the coast. Here we enjoy a local brunch before sauntering to the beach. Some head out to look for climbs and find wondrous 7a’s that they send and then return to meet the
others. Walking down the beach, everyone
stops off for a tasty sea side dinner of fish and
meats and beers and soft drinks. As the sun
goes down everyone has a cheeky boulder by
the sea and some choose to brave the
refreshing sea waters with their pants on.
Eventually everyone returns to the cars and
heads back to the campsite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="8th-april"&gt;8th April
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tired, some people work their projects but most cherry pick easier climbs in relaxed fashion.
Federico unfortunately takes a bit of a tumble, catching his foot as he is caught by the rope. He is
first aided back to camp and splinted. People are sad for Federico, but Federico is still happy, as
always. That night people reminisce about the trip they are on as they realise that there are only a
few days left to send.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="9th-april"&gt;9th April
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sending day and everyone’s on form. Jamie narrowly
misses sending his 7b, Ben waddles his way up a 7c
and everyone seems happy with the marked
improvement in their climbing both physically and
from a technical proficiency angle. AS Federico is still
in pain he is taken to ER and patched up properly, he
returns gloriously with a crutch and a smile.
Everyone celebrates with food and beer and soft
drinks with the street dogs and cats they have
befriended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="10th-april"&gt;10th April
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;People pack their bags and ferry onto the bus back to
the airport. Using Laura, we find our flight and
Federico is wheeled away. Once everyone has explained to the security that Ben is not a terror suspect, he is allowed to take his quick draws onto
the plane and everyone settles down. In London
people say their goodbyes but only till term starts again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="note-to-reader"&gt;Note to Reader
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It may seem that not a lot happened on this holiday but due to the vicinity and ease with which it
was possible to climb nearly un ending number of routes, people spent most of the holiday revelling
in the ecstasy that is summer sport climbing. Too much was climbed to possibly note down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="trip-list"&gt;Trip List

&lt;li&gt;Nicola McCallion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jamie Bamforth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Laura Braun&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2 id="objectives"&gt;Objectives
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For everyone to enjoy 2 weeks of sport climbing in the sun!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For members to improve their sport climbing ability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To experience and take advantage of a much better standard of sport climbing than
is available in the UK.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no doubt that the tour fulfilled its objectives. Everyone had a great time, the quality
of sport climbing was excellent, and many people boosted their sport climbing grade by a
substantial amount; Sam and Milan boosted their grades from 6a+ to 6c and I went from
climbing 6c+ to 7b.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="attendees"&gt;Attendees
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id="friday-september-6th"&gt;Friday, September 6th
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first seven of us took our flight in today. Hamzah reinforced his position of club chopper
by trying to bring the most lethal looking ice screw I’ve ever seen onto the plane. The
security were nice enough not to arrest him, but he did lose his ice-screw-dagger. We
arrived in Reus at around 8pm and from there took a taxi straight to the campsite in Siurana.
We were immediately greeted by the campsite owners who were really friendly, and kept
the kitchen open late to get us all fed! After choosing our rooms in the campsite cabins and
moving all our stuff in, we went to bed setting an alarm for an early start tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="saturday-september-7th"&gt;Saturday, September 7th
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A thunderstorm looming overhead
prevented people from doing much
climbing in the morning&amp;hellip; off to a good
start! Andy and I (Will) set off hitch-hiking
to the nearby town Cornudella, to buy food
supplies for the next few days. Other than
getting hopelessly lost and accidentally
hitch-hiking to a huge dam this was
successful. Meanwhile the rest of the
group spent the day slacklining and
meeting other climbers on the campsite.
Hannes – one guy we met – was kind
enough to drive some of us to a crag later
on in the day when it had dried out.
Cheehan, Dak and Rosanna arrived today!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/summer-tour-2013/images/0.jpg"

&lt;p&gt;Hamzah showing off his slacklining skills&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sunday-september-8th"&gt;Sunday, September 8th
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are all up early to head to a nearby
crag – Can Marges - which has a range
of easy and hard routes for the day.
Everyone gets a good few climbs in. At
midday it gets really hot so we have a
break, and after another thunderstorm
at 5 we head back. This was our first
real go on Spanish rock as a group, and
everyone founds the climbs hard. This
rock will take some getting used to!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/summer-tour-2013/images/2.jpg" width="300"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="monday-september-9th"&gt;Monday, September 9th
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bulk of the group headed to Can Parasit to
climb in the morning. We were lucky to have
Hannes to drive some of us into town for food
shopping! Everyone regroups at the campsite at 4
and then heads back out to Can Parasit. Some of
us take fall practice to get confidence sport
climbing and some hard routes are attempted
until it gets dark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/summer-tour-2013/images/3.jpg" width="300"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tuesday-september-10th"&gt;Tuesday, September 10th
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Up super early. Scrambled eggs. The majority of people leave to Can Parasit again as it was
popular yesterday. Me Amar Michael and Hannes drive to Arboli, a beautiful crag just out of
walking distance. We climb a variety of routes ranging from 6a to 7b+. We had something
loosely resembling Piella for tea, took advantage of the unpolluted sky stargazing, then all
retreated to bed!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="wednesday-september-11th"&gt;Wednesday, September 11th
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We spent the day at Grau del Masetes. There was a nice section of wall with a range of
easier routes that became the social hub of the crag. Lunch was Local baguettes with a
monstrous portion of nutella. Michael won chopper of the day award by trying to climb one
face of a chimney problem making it magnitudes harder, and benighting a small group of us
by getting a rope stuck at the top of a route!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="thursday-september-12th"&gt;Thursday, September 12th
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We went to Grau del Masetes again. A portion of the
day was spent trying a 6a and 6a+ overhang at the
‘social hub’ of the crag. We also spent a long time all
trying a classic 6b nearby, with Michael taking photos
from a rope he had set up next to the route.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="friday-september-13th"&gt;Friday, September 13th
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rest day today! Much slacklining was done! A number of people visited Siurana village
during the day. Charlie, Sam, Will Smith, Milan and Jack arrived later today. Amar had to go
back, and the campsite owners were kind enough to offer to drive him all the way to Reus
themselves! (A two hour round trip)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="saturday-september-14th"&gt;Saturday, September 14th
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a morning excursion through a small jungle to a crag we wrongly thought would be big
enough for all of us, we headed to Can Melafots. This is the famous crag at Siurana, and with
good reason! It consists of a long stretch of amazing overhanging red rock, overlooking a
beautiful view of the lake nearby. It was obvious this crag would be visited many more times
this trip!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sunday-september-15th"&gt;Sunday, September 15th
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Due to a number of complaints about it being too hot, some people went to a shaded crag,
Reserva India. The rest of the group headed to Can Melafots again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="monday-september-16th"&gt;Monday, September 16th
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We spent the day at Grau del Masetes, to show the new-comers the crag. A number of
people had a go at a short 7a+ with a really hard boulder move at the top. Only Jack got it!
Since everyone feels pretty spent we decided upon a rest day tomorrow. This is great news
because it allows us to indulge in all the Spanish wine we can get our hands on with no fear
of climbing hung-over!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tuesday-september-17th"&gt;Tuesday, September 17th
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally a full rest-day! Everyone had a big lie-in and then we trekked down to the lake for
some swimming. A herd of goats pestered us when we were all sitting by the lake. From the
lake we headed to Town to buy food and have a few drinks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="wednesday-september-18th"&gt;Wednesday September 18th
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Me, Antje, Will Smith, Charlie, Milan, Jack and Jakov left early to go to the crag El Detot. The
rest were chilling out or climbing at Can Melafots. Michael got his 7c project, and I got a 7a I
had been trying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="thursday-september-19th"&gt;Thursday September 19th
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today is the last day of real climbing! Everyone with projects they want to do has to get the
today! Me and Michael had a 7b and 7c+ project at Can Melafots to finish. I got the 7b and
was given a gummy-bear as a reward. We all drank a lot with dinner and for some reason
had a food-fight with spaghetti&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="friday-september-20th"&gt;Friday September 20th
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We got the campsite owners to order us a taxi for 3:30. The morning was spent packing and
clearing up the huts, primarily removing spaghetti from the walls. We had quite a large
amount of euros left over so thought we would splash out on a nice meal for lunch! We
went to a pizzeria in Siurana Village with Hannes before saying bye and heading off!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;24th March - 1st April 2013&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trip got off to a good start with everyone
turning up on time at Beit. The car and bus
were packed and we set off to Wales via a
Sainsburys at around 2pm. We arrived at the
hut hassle free, at about 11pm. The next day
marked the first day of climbing. With the
LLanberis pass being closed, going to
Tramadog had to be cancelled and instead
an attempt was made to climb some of the
boulders at the roadside crag in the
Cromlech. Here it was very cold and windy
so the party quickly bailed into the bus stop quarry for a spot of easy sport
climbing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/easter-tour-2013/images/4.jpg" width="300"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/easter-tour-2013/images/5.jpg" width="300"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day 2 saw successful passage to Tramadog and the first day of trad
climbing. Novices were introduced to the world of multi pitch trad,
climbing with more experienced members of the trip. A pleasant time was
had by all, pootling up some HS’s. Meanwhile the boulderers were
climbing around the Bustach boulders
with Will climbing his first V7. Once
everyone had reconvened at
Tremadog, the bus took people back to
the hut and the car took some
boulderers off to Elephantitus for an
evening session seeing a few more
hard sends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day 4 was a rest day spent wandering
about gear shops and staring at rocks
from a distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day 5 split the tour into sport climbers and boulderers. The sport climbers
were dropped off at the Castle Inn and the boulderers found themselves
the cave. Everyone had a good day enjoying yet another improbably dry
day. The boulderers suffered defeats across the board and vowed to return
to finish projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day 6 was a return to the Cromlech where Jo eventually sent her first V
but in general it was too cold for most people. That evening we retired to
Ben’s house in southern Snowdonia as the hut became unavailable. Thefollowing day was sent resting, biking and slack lining here in secluded
central wales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/easter-tour-2013/images/6.jpg" width="300"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day 8 again split the tour, the sport
climbers dropped at Penmaen Head
where Milkins sent his first 6b outdoors.
The boulderers returned to battle in the
cave with partial success. Jack just missed
out on his V9 project, Jordan sent Clever
Beaver V7, Chris climbed something hard
and Ben sent his first V9, Rock Atrocity. All
in all a respectable tick list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day 9 was our last, making it back to Beit by 9:30pm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall the trip was a success, especially as the destination had to be
changed at such short notice due to the lack of drivers. The trip was very
cheap and we made the most of very fortunate weather. All the novices
were introduced to multi pitch trad climbing and the trip maintained a
relaxed feeling. Honourable mention to Chris, without his solo bus driving effort,
the trip would not have been possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="finances"&gt;Finances
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trip cost a total of £1031.79, travel cost a total of £686.08 which is less than
was originally budgeted for so only £257.28 of the funding was calculated as
37.5% of the travel cost of the trip. The trip then cost members a total of £
each.
These figures are before the Union’s retrospective moderation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="difficulties--objectives"&gt;Difficulties &amp;amp; Objectives
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Due to mass drop out of drivers in the closing stages of organising the tour, the
trip was almost cancelled but instead was rapidly switched to Wales at the last
minute. This lead to the tour being, initially, quite disorganised. However, given
the circumstances, the trip went as well as can be expected; with Christopher
Hunt offering to do all of the driving and Benjamin Coope donating the use of his
car. We managed to climb every day that we weren’t resting, there were no injuries and everyone had a great time. All the novices gained experience in
climbing outdoors and the trip was run to the slimmest of budgets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assorted photos&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the 25th March to 6th April 20 members of ICMC travelled to the national park Paklenica for 2 weeks of climbing! Much fun was had by all, many climbs were climbed, many cheap Croatian pizzas were eaten and a number of local delicacies devoured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paklenica is famous for a river gorge lined with steep limestone cliffs up to 350m high which makes it
ideal for big wall climbing. The climbing is protected by permanent bolts which made it accessible for
even the more inexperienced members of the trip. The climbing experience of the members was
highly variable therefore inexperienced members were partnered with two more experienced
members to teach them the necessary skills to climb multipitch routes. All members experienced
multipitch sport climbing on various routes. The other main activity in the area is single pitch
climbing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trip ran smoothly, there was no language barrier as most locals spoke English. Nobod
experienced any serious injury, all members wore helmets and had guidance on how to safely
practise rope climbing. Accommodation worked out quite cheap at £10pppn and food worked out at
slightly cheaper than that in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tour subsidy was used to help members pay for their flights from London Stansted to Zadar in
Croatia. The number of people attending the trip far exceeded that of any other tours in previous
years, I thought it unfair to cap the number of people on the trip and allowed all members who were
interested to attend. An application for subsidy unfortunately was aimed at a smaller group and
therefore each member received less subsidy than planned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other than this the trip ran smoothly. Steps were made to keep the price to a minimum, the main
expenditures included: flights, transport to and from the airport (via cheap local taxis), food and
entrance fee to the Paklenica national park. Most members had their own climbing gear, those that didnd&amp;rsquo;t were able to borrow gear from the club&amp;rsquo;s store room and many bought new gear for the trip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="1-introduction"&gt;1 Introduction
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the Easter break of 2011 members of Imperial College Mountaineering Club (ICMC) departed
on a 14 day trip that would take them through 3 different countries in their quest for climbing.
Taking the union minibus these brave adventurers drove 2276 miles through tunnels, over
mountains, off road and even on the flat. Due to several members dropping out and several other
members lacking just one of the requirements to be able to drive there were only two drivers of the
minibus for the duration of the trip. Most of the team returned with no injuries&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were several aims and objectives for the tour, primary aim of the tour were to take members
of the club to a number of locations and climb on a range of rock types and in styles unusual to that
of the UK. Other aims were for members to improve their ability and to climb in styles that they
were not so used to. The Pyrenees also offered some longer multipitch climbs that are far larger
than anything available in the UK and these were the main target of some members of the tour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four distinctly different rock types were seen on tour, these were limestone, sand stone, granite and
conglomerate however within these broad rock types there were a range of styles from slabs to
overhangs. All members felt they had improved and were stronger towards the end of the trip.
Certain crags offered very interesting routes which combined different styles of climbing such as
steep over hangs into technical slabs which was very rewarding to climb on. While multi pitch climbs
were done by all members the attempt at Enfants de la Dalle (a 1000m+ route) was called off for
concerns about the safety of the attempt. The Pyrenees mountain range has a lot to offer in the way
of climbing, another tour could easily be run and not have to climb in any of the same areas. It would
also be of value to return in the future and climb some of the routes that defeated the climbers this
time around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For future tours there are some lessons to be learnt. While taking the minibus is a reasonable way to
travel it is slower and more tiring than flying. The minibus did have the major advantages of being
able to take all of the equipment and did allow the tour to visit a lot more areas than would have
been practical if flights had been used. The main problem was the lack of drivers, only having two
drivers meant that they were very tired at the end of long stretches of driving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A final issue, which only became apparent after the tour was finished, was the amount of things
done on tour. So much was crammed into the 14 days that an extensive tour report was required to
describe the events of the tour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="2-people"&gt;2 People
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The people who went on the tour were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Matthew Lees (Murray)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edward Stott&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tristan Pollitt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jonathan Price&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Elliot Carrington (Choss Master)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adrian Jeakins*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Michael Jones (Fails)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jonathan Mason (The American)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Justine Courty*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All people on the tour were full members of ICMC at the time&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*These members were not present for the entire trip&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="3-tour-diary"&gt;3 Tour Diary
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id="31-day-1--beit"&gt;3.1 Day 1 – Beit
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While most students were finishing up for the term and moving over to the union to relax and have
a few drinks before going home for Easter the ICMC members were busy packing the bus and getting
ready for their 2 weeks away. Murray had spent the morning chasing various Sabbaticals and union
staff for money, bus keys and tarps and had managed to get it all together in time for the bus to be
packed and make a slightly delayed departure at 7 pm. Heading towards the euro tunnel took from
South Kensington took the bus through central London which was packed. Eventually the motor way
was reached and the lack of a 6th gear became annoyingly obvious with the engine droning away in
5 th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The euro tunnel was reached in remarkably good time considering the traffic and late get away. The
spare hour was used by most to wonder around the terminal but Ed took this opportunity to climb
on top of the bus and have a snooze. The train was boarded just before midnight and departed on
time&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="32-day-2--font"&gt;3.2 Day 2 – Font
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arriving in France shortly after departing and not
being entirely sure of the time anymore Ed took the
wheel and headed towards Fontainebleau; we
arrived much earlier than expected. Since it was
still dark all the members decided to find their own
sleeping spots and have a good sleep before the
day’s bouldering. Some members slept in the bus,
some in the woods, and Ed chose the top of the bus
again. The people who had chosen to sleep in the
woods were woken first by the numerous dogs that
went to investigate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a good breakfast of cereal the group moved
off into the forest to find the boulders they had
come looking for. Murray, Ed, Fails and Choss
Master set off on the purple circuit which proved to
be just the right difficulty. There were some
interesting problems as well as a high ball part and
an impressive tunnel to crawl through. At lunch
time the 4 decided to head back to base camp for
food and while walking back Choss Master had a
disagreement with a rock, the disagreement escalated into a fight. Choss Master decided that the
best option was to head but the rock but this proved to be a bad idea. After sending someone for ice
at the cafe and making Choss Master sit still for a while they continued back to base camp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That afternoon Fails found an impressive looking roof section that he managed to climb after a few
goes, Murray and Choss Master both climbed it afterwards. Ed and Jon both slept on top of the roof
being climbed while The American did some impressive spotting for those on the roof. After
everyone had climbed themselves out for the day they got back on the bus and headed for
Targasonne stopping in some services for Chilli.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="33-day-3--targasonne"&gt;3.3 Day 3 – Targasonne
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;After some more speedy driving at 100 kph by Ed and Murray Targasonne was reached ahead of
schedule and again people decided to sleep by the road instead of going straight for the climbing.
Just when everyone had got to sleep it began to rain, most people dived straight into the bus but Jon
and Ed had other ideas, they slipped under the bus to use it as a shelter and both slept there. A
couple of hours later an angry French man turned up and told us we were in the wrong place, the
bouldering was further out of town, and he told us to get out of the lay-by we were in. Seeing the
rain hadn’t stopped and not wanting to get in trouble the decision was made to make a break for the
border. On the way there was a rather long tunnel and the tunnel game was introduced to all (where
one holds their breath while in the tunnel), unfortunately the 13 km tunnel proved far too long for
anyone to finish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later that day the bus rolled into their new home for the next week and set up camp, this time in the
right place. On the Spanish side the weather was much more favourable with no sign of rain, not
wanting to waste the rest of the day everyone jumped back into the bus and went to the closest crag
that had things easier than 7a; Crestes De Conill. After getting spanked by the easiest of climbs and
blaming it on being tired and on unusual rock the team returned to the campsite. Homemade
burgers were on the menu that evening, after burning all of them in an effort to avoid food
poisoning everyone turned in for the first good night’s sleep to be had in a couple of days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="34-day-4--conglomerate"&gt;3.4 Day 4 – Conglomerate
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;After waking up to surprisingly good health after dinner the night before a relaxed pace was adopted
for this days climbing. The destination was an area called Collegats, quite a large area of
conglomerate climbing. Most of the routs had a boulder start, easy middle and a difficult top section.
The conglomerate rock had an interesting mix of hidden jugs and a lot of traps. Fails and Choss
Master decided to demonstrate their punter like skills by setting up a top rope on a 6c and did not
attempt the lead. Murray tried a 6a on lead but had to retreat and let fails rescue his quick draws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some refreshing rain started at the end of the day making the decision to end climbing and go back
to camp for everyone. Dinner that night was a tuna and tomato pasta dish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="35-day-5--lleida"&gt;3.5 Day 5 – Lleida
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was the first time breakfast had been porridge on
the trip. The plan was to have a rest day and go into
Lleida to pick up Adrian who had flown in late after
needing to finish project work. In Lleida the food
supplies were restocked and lunch consisted of 2 Kg of
mystery meat purchased at the reasonable sum of €4.
Decathlon was next on the shopping trip for people to
restock on climbing equipment they had decided they
needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a phone call from Adrian saying there was a delay
and he would be getting into Lleida 2 hours later than
originally planned the idea of a rest day was scrapped
and the guide book was reached for. The closest
climbing to Lleida was a cave with a number of routs
ranging from 8a to unclimbed, deciding this was a bit
hard bouldering a bit further away was chosen. After
about half an hour driving on a dirt track into the desert
leaving a massive dust cloud in the wake of the bus the
boulders were discovered with the tell tale chalk of a
long history of being climbed. A number of hard
powerful problems were climbed and many remained
unclimbed even after ridiculous back breaking beta was
used. Once Adrian was picked up from the train station
and the short journey back to camp completed dinner
was put on, this time it was carbonara.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="36-day-6--accident"&gt;3.6 Day 6 – Accident
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The destination for climbing this day was Camarossa. Being a road side crag made access very easy,
luckily the road lead to a hydro electric plant and had very little traffic on it. Being at the bottom of a
valley there was no direct sun for much of the day. Fails had spotted a short 6c+ that had a powerful
crux, ideal for the Westway climber. After some working he eventually got it clean, attempts were
made by Murray and Choss Master but were unsuccessful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While climbing elsewhere Ed took a rather large lob (4 – 5 m) whilst trying to clip a bolt.
Unfortunately during the fall he inverted in the harness and hit his head on the rock below, he was
not wearing a helmet at the time. At first glance the injury was quite bad; there was a lot of blood on
Ed and the rock. On closer inspection while the cut was deep it was not through to the skull so it was
bandaged up. Within a short period Ed was feeling much better but decided not to climb anymore
that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further up the road from the crag was an interesting looking cave which had a couple of inches of
water in the bottom. The cave was large enough for a car to drive down and the tell tale tyre marks
at the entrance confirmed this had been done. The cave extended about 100 m into the rock, made
a turn and ended. It was concluded that this was a secret government facility with a concealed
entrance and we would all disappear if exploration continued. Dinner that evening was a BBQ which
was enjoyed by all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="37-day-7--schorchio"&gt;3.7 Day 7 – Schorchio!
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The morning was spent in the town of Balaguer stocking up on food. While the team were shopping
Fails took decided to go for a haircut. On the return from the hairdressers to the bus he managed to
get lost and needed to be rescued by Ed. Fully stocked the team left the town to find some climbing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After parking next to a bee hive the team walked up to the climbs at Cubells. This was by far the
hottest day of the trip. The crag was south facing and right a t the end of the foot hills, from the base
of the walk in the land was flat for as far as the eye could see. While the climbing was very good the
heat was exhausting and the constant bees following the climbers up the crag were annoying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Returning to camp a curry was cooked up
and eaten in very little time. Just before
going to bed some members decided to
take showers, one of these members was
Fails. It turned out that fails had forgotten
his towel and thought that the best
solution was to dance in front of the hand
dryer in his boxers until fully dried. This
matter was not aided by people flicking
water at him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="38-day-8--birthday"&gt;3.8 Day 8 – Birthday
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a day of being roasted by the Spanish
sun a rest day was called for. Various
activities were devised by members.
Revision was a popular idea but very little
was achieved. Some members went on a
walk around the camp site and found a
chain of 65 caterpillars following each
other nose to tail. Attempts to join the 2
ends of the chain together failed so they
were left alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later a trip was organised into Balaguer to restock on food again. While in town the idea of ice
creams was put forwards, unfortunately at a mere 32 o the local ice cream shop felt it was too cold
for anyone to buy ice creams and had not opened. While wondering around town a rather unusual
shop was discovered that had many sweet
deals, fails was in heaven and splashed out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once all the entertainments of Balaguer were
exhausted swimming in the river was suggested
and all members agreed this was a perfect way
to cool off, near to the camp site was a lake that
looked ideal. At the entrance to the lake a small
bridge crossed, at approximately 5 m high it was
a good height for jumping into the river from.
After extensive testing by throwing rocks of
various size into the river it was deemed safe
enough for Fails to jump in. Driving the minibus
off the bridge and into the river was also put
forwards as a more conclusive test but the
barriers next to the road prevented this. After
Fails jumped into the water with a small Spanish
audience and survived it was then considered
safe enough for the other more valuable
members to enter. Murray took the longest to get over his psyche problem but did jump in the
end. The water was very cold and quick exits
were made by all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some issues with the stoves catching fire
due to leaky petrol canisters chilli was served
but, rather unusually for ICMC, there was also a
desert on offer. The desert was a quadruple
chocolate cake hand crafted for The American’s
birthday. It consisted of 2 chocolate sponges
glued together with melted chocolate, covered
in more melted chocolate, with chocolate eggs
on top each with a soft chocolate centre.
Candles were fashioned from the left over
cheese wax wrapped around sticks and soaked
in petrol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="39-day-9--policía"&gt;3.9 Day 9 – Policía
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was to be the last day spent in Spain. The
tent was packed up with impressive speed and
everything was ready to go so fast that the
reception was not yet open. After waiting for
reception to open and paying for the camp site
ICMC was on the road again. Heading north
towards France they stopped to check out
Pachamama, Chris Sharma’s famous 9a+, all
were amazed at the size of it and how over hanging it was. While having lunch it was realised that
more people had been to the moon than had climbed that piece of rock. With that sobering thought
they got back on the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crag for the day was located on an abandoned stretch of highway that was left to crumble after
the new highway was constructed that tunnelled straight through the rock rather than winding
around the valley. The abandoned highway could easily be from a scene in a post apocalyptic film
and as such everyone was on guard for zombies or gangs who might want our supplies. The walk up
to the crag was steep and had a lot of loose rock, once at the top everyone immediately found a
bush to hide behind as the sun was beating down again. Finishing climbing early as there was still a
lot of driving to do that day they got back on the road and played the tunnel game, again being
defeated by the 13 km monster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While on the road heading towards France the bus was waved over by the policía, they asked for the
drivers licence and there seemed to be some problem with it not being valid for the type of vehicle
being driven. Trying to explain it only had 9 seats so was not category D failed due to the language
barrier. One of the policía seemed interested in what we had on the room and after shouts of
“escalada” their attitude changed and they waved us on. Deciding that they would not hang around
long enough for the policía to change their mind they made a break for the border. There was an
interesting detour from the main road that the sat-nav seemed to think was better, while being a lot more picturesque it was unclear if it was any faster. Arriving at the very cheap camping municipal
after a long hill climb in the bus the team settled down for what might be a rather cold night due to
the altitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="310-day-10--la-dent-dorlu"&gt;3.10 Day 10 – La Dent d’Orlu
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Waking up to a surprisingly warm morning considering the altitude the first views of the new scenery
were seen and impressed all. There was still snow on top of many of the mountains and the ski lift
was running. The plan for the day was to check out a mountain called La Dent d’Orlu, on the south
and east faces were many multi pitch climbs, one of which was of particular interest: Les Enfants de
la Dalle. This rout had been chosen by Murray and Jon as their main target for the tour, the total
height was 1100 m of rock made of 28 pitches all needing to be done in 1 day. Today was going to be
a reconnaissance trip in order to climb some smaller routes and work out where then needed to be
for the main ascent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The town of Aux les Thermes was called at for fuel and food before heading to Orlu to find the
mountain. Parking in a large car park at the bottom the first views of the climb were intimidating to
say the least. A huge face of dark stone that looked much higher and steeper than expected with the
top few hundred meters capped in snow greeted the climbers and they had not even done the walk
in yet. The topo suggested a 30 minute walk in but this was more like an hour and 30 up steep
woodland with a difficult to follow path. Reaching the bottom of the climbs a well deserved lunch
was had. Part way through lunch a rock landed a couple of meters away from the happy picnickers,
from the sound it was estimated to be going very fast and about toaster size. Helmets were donned
by all who had them and the guide book was placed over the head of the one member who had left
theirs behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While scoping out routs, rain drops could be felt and the weather looked like it might be about to
take a turn for the worse. Large seepage patches could be seen and few bolts could. The decision
was made to abandon climbing here as it was unsuitable for teaching multipitch and would have
been potentially dangerous even for the experienced climbers. The walk out was no better than the
walk in and would have been near impossible if the sky had opened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A crag much closer to the camp site was located with a good selection of climbs and even some
multipitch. It turned out to be an interesting mix of some technical slab and powerful overhangs and
was very enjoyable. Fails and Choss Master climbed a 6c, when Murray attempted it he slid down
the slab section losing some fingertips. Jon and Murray climbed a multipitch and had a difficult
conversation half way up, they decided that it was not a good idea to climb Enfants as it would be
too dangerous and getting benighted was a certainty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Returning to camp after an exhausting day of walking up hills everyone was in the mood for a less
strenuous day the next day so bouldering was again on the table. Dinner was carbonara.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="311-day-11--the-mountain-pass"&gt;3.11 Day 11 – The Mountain Pass
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deciding to take an easy day after all the fell wondering the day before a group decision was made
to do some hard bouldering Targasonne. Realising that it was on the other side of the 13 km an
alternate route was looked for to avoid the toll, a mountain pass over the tunnel was found which
was open so this became the new route, the sat nav objected heavily. Driving up the zig zagging
roads was reasonably fun until the bus entered fog that was as thick as pea soup, then the drivers realised they had made an amazing decision and the trip was to be a lot more fun. After some time
of driving with about 15 m visibility the bus suddenly left the fog into the sunny clear air on the other
side of the mountain, turning a corner the team got a view of what they had just driven out of. It
looked rather like someone had dropped a large amount of dry ice on France and the smoke was
pouring through the cull.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arriving at Targasonne and not having a guide book meant finding the climbing was rather difficult,
driving along the road many small boulders were pointed out until rounding a corner a gigantic
boulder field appeared and it was obvious where they were meant to go. Parking in a road version of
an oxbow lake, the bus was unloaded and everyone headed off in the direction of the closest
boulders. The plan was to wonder around and find cool looking problems to try and not worry about
grades or what was possible, a plan which proved to be excellent. The first big boulder that base
camp was set up at had a number of problems on which were all enjoyable. The top out appeared
flat when climbing but long chalk streamers ran down the top of the rock that guided the hands to
hidden jugs. People wondered around for a while each picking out their own rocks of interest. Fails
and Adrian found an impressive problem that they spent most of the day working requiring difficult
moves into under cuts and a top out that was not particularly friendly. After many attempts and
almost at the end of the day Adrian almost made an ascent but failed at the final move when he
tried to pull onto the top but found there were only prickly bushes, making a dynamic retreat all the
observers saw his grazed torso caused by the top out. Inspired by this effort fails put a tee-shirt on
and managed to top out the problem grading it V6+ or V7. Several other problems were climbed and
not climbed and overall everyone had a very good day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sharp granite had taken its toll and everyone’s fingertips were feeling very thin. The journey
back involved driving back through the fog again which was no thinner. Dinner that night was
another BBQ. Some members decided to eat in to the next day’s lunch rations and cook some
bananas with chocolate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="312-day-12--choss"&gt;3.12 Day 12 – Choss
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking through the guide book for some multipitch climbs that everyone could do the location
Sinsat 1, Le Pubis, sector GR4B+ was chosen. Upon arriving the discovery was made that the climbs
were half way up a mountain, the long walk in the baking sub began. While walking up the foot path
it was noted that a number of the climbs on different walls could be linked to make a multipitch
ascent which was much longer than the guide book had first indicated, some French climbers were
doing this. The topo used for the Foix area was printed from the internet, if pictures had been
included it would have been easier to identify the crags and it may have been noticed that the
various climbs could be linked up sooner. The climbs were good quality with little polish. This was
some member’s first experience of the slightly sparse nature of multipitch bolting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While climbing Fails and Ed reached the top anchor first, this anchor was shared between two routs
and Murray and Jon were on the other route. While Murray and Jon had set off first, Fails and Ed
had the advantage of one
less pitch. Murray and Jon’s
route finished with a good
jamming crack that would
have been a quality trad lead.
With the French climbers
closing in from the bottom
Murray had to unclip some of
Fail’s quick draws after Fails
was safely on the anchor and
build his own as there was
not enough space on the
existing one. The top out was
covered in choss, some of
which was knocked down by
almost everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the first set of groups
topped out they began their
walk down so that they could
rest and prepare for the next
climb. The second set of
climbers topped out and
descended without trouble.
This left the Choss Master
and the American as the last
group to finish the climb. The
Choss Master had earned his&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;name previously by knocking off vast quantities of choss onto his b-layers all trip, and this climb was
no exception. Using the radios to warn of the large quantities of choss descending the cliff allowed
everyone time to run for cover, after the first load helmets were replaced. During the descent the
two climbers took a wrong turn, after some time the other members became concerned about their
absence. They were on the far side of a ridge, so radio contact was useless. After some time radio
contact was re-established by walking to the top of the ridge and all was well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision was made back at camp to travel back to Font that evening so as to have more
bouldering time. A curry was cooked up by fails and the tent packed in record time and ICMC were
on the road again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="313-day-13--loughborough"&gt;3.13 Day 13 – Loughborough
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arriving at Font very early in the
morning a few hours sleep were
had in the forest again. Another
member of ICMC would be joining
for just the 1 day of climbing;
Justine who lived in Paris got the
train to join us. Numerous
problems were climbed including
one with many monos in it, finding
the monos difficult to hold Murray
climbed it without the m. A slab
next to base camp was found and
it had few holds, a few finger nail
crimps and smears, it was alto
slightly slimy. Attempts were made
by most people who all slid down
its face. Murray used the incredible
friction of his stealth onyx rubber
to climb it using the crimps and
later eliminated these as well
proving once again that 5.10 make
the best rubber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going to a real campsite this time
ICMC met Loughborough university
mountaineering club. It turned out
that they were on their annual trip to font for 10 days. They were all very impressed by our big red
bus and were even more amazed after they found out what we had been doing for the last two
weeks. Some members of Loughborough had slack lines and were very skilled at it, one member
having a 100 m long one at home. The evening was spent sitting around the camp fire exchanging
stories eating chilli with a slightly soapy taste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="314-day-14--blood-sweat-and-washing-up-liquid"&gt;3.14 Day 14 – Blood, Sweat and Washing up Liquid
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having a lazy start to the day everyone stayed in bed for a while before getting up and showering.
While preparing breakfast washing up liquid was found all over one of the boxes and needed
cleaning out, this explained the interesting flavour in the previous nights meal, on the positive side
the cooking box was the cleanest it had been since it was new. The tent was packed up one last time
and farewells were said to the Loughborough climbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Travelling to a different area of Font this day. Jon was feeling very ill so spent most of the day asleep.
A blue circuit was attempted but it was poorly sign posted so was abandoned. Murray found an even
bigger, steeper smoother slab to climb which took him quite a long time to work but he got it in the
end. A large overhanging bulge was found by Fails and Adrian who worked out beta and climbed it,
other members tried and Murray managed it after many goes. While driving back to a different car
park to have dinner Murray had a random nose bleed while driving so pulled over and let Ed finish.
The last supper was carbonara and everyone was full to bursting after eating it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setting off on the drive back to England the decision was made to avoid the toll roads since there
was so much spare time before the train left. Most of the drive back was on minor roads and
through villages, this didn’t have much impact as the speed limits were all 100 kph so the bus was
maxed out anyway. Arriving at the terminal 4 hours early the bus was upgraded for free onto a much
earlier train so that they arrived back into the UK in god time. Arriving at the union shortly after
dawn the bus was unpacked and all the equipment dumped into stores to be sorted at a later date.
Keys, first aid kit and minibus documentation returned to the SAC, all the members went their
separate ways to get a proper sleep in a bed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;10 members of Imperial College Mountaineering Club travelled to the sunny
island of Mallorca from the 12th to the 25th September. Not for the cheap thrills of
Shagaluf but for the vast amounts of climbing on offer. While on tour many
different areas were visited with all sorts of climbing on offer from caves to slabs.
Some members achieved very highly whereas others had a less fortunate time.
The aims and objectives of the tour were for members to climb in a different
environment to those that they are used to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Mallorca the climbing was all sport
or deep water soloing which are less common in the UK. There were also some
longer multi pitch routs that members enjoyed climbing. Due to unforeseen
circumstances 2 members had to use their recently acquired advanced first aid
skills to help one team member out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall Mallorca was an excellent location to visit. There was a wide range of
grades from very easy to very hard. A lot of the very interesting routs were
harder than many members could climb. Despite being a relatively small island
there was a significant amount of driving. We managed to take advantage of
cheap villas due to the off peak season and found some cheap car rental places,
food was also remarkably low cost. We all learnt the hard way that accidents can
happen, even when not doing a particularly difficult climb and we must always
be aware of hazards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Top Row: Ruth, Jon, Ali, Lisa, Ollie, Elliot, Murray. Bottom Row: Tristan, Abi, Fails&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="people"&gt;People
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The people going on the tour were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Matthew Lees (Murray) - President&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mike Jones (Fails) – Vice President&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jonathan Price&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alastair Brash&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lisa Alhadeff&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Elliot Carrington&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tristan Pollitt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ruth Lawson&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Abi Attrell&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oliver Mower&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="diary"&gt;Diary
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id="day-1--flight"&gt;Day 1 – Flight
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;With 10 members flying from all over the country to Palma it was quite
remarkable that all but one person had met in the country just after noon. The
one member who had decided to take a later flight for a sweet deal wouldn’t
arrive until much later that night and cause much unnecessary driving, the fuel
for which probably cancelled out his own saving. Picking up the cars turned out
to be not as simple as expected, the rental firm was too cheap to buy a place in
the airport and needed a bus to get there. The cars however were very cheap
and were already scratched and dented, as a bonus hey came with free
insurance meaning we wouldn’t get fined for bumping the car.
Driving out of Palma proved to be difficult but after a scenic drive around the city
the motorway was found and the other side of the island quickly reached.
Arriving at the accommodation Ali was convinced that the lead diver Murray was
completely lost but was surprised when it turned out that they had arrived at
their accommodation. The villa was perfect for the club needs and was very
cheap. Classic ICMC Chilli was had for dinner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/summer-tour-2011/images/0.jpg" width="300"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="day-2--el-fumat"&gt;Day 2 – El Fumat
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first crag to be visited on the trip was
thought to be a local crag called El Fumat,
but turned out to be the other side of a
mountain so there was some slow uphill
diving. The crag had excellent views and
was well bolted. Most members found the
grades to be hard; this was probably due
to the new location and tiredness. On the
menu for dinner was Curry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="day-3--les-perxes"&gt;Day 3 – Les Perxes
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The area chosen today had a couple of
different crags. Most of the group went to
the easier section near the car park called
Hairpin but Ali and Lisa decided to go for
the cave nearby. The easy crag got sun
around 2 and became too hot for climbing,
the cave being north facing remained cool
all day. Some members decided to go
watch the cave climbing and take photos but others went to the higher crag that
had a little bit more shade.
Ali managed to climb an impressive climb up with some good tufa action and a
nice rest in the middle. One of the local climbers then crushed it while warming
up for a much harder climb. Carbonara was on the table tonight, there was much
debate over what the ingredients should be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/summer-tour-2011/images/1.jpg" width="300"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="day-4--deep-water-solo"&gt;Day 4 – Deep Water Solo
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being the tour’s first venture into DWS an easy small crag was chosen. There
were 3 routs on the smallest section; the 6a was enjoyable and easy and done by
most. The water was very clear and we could easily see that the bottom was
a long way down There was a good 7a with a cool dino in the middle which
many people fell off. Some members quickly decided they didn’t like DWS
and others needed to work on jumping off to get over a fear of height. Some
members had no problem jumping off the cliffs but had some minor issues
entering the water.
At the top of the cliff there was a mast, probably used for sailing the island
to new locations, where we left all of our food and bags. Ali, Ruth and Lisa
managed to hit their heads on the mast; unfortunately since they were not
climbing at this point in time they didn’t have helmets on, all 3 felt very silly.
A DWS dinghy was bought to help get people to the bottom of the climbs
and to rescue them in case something went wrong. Various names were put
forward, there were: Lizzie Wilkins, Fun Splash, Enema, Ella and Emma. After
some debate the name Ella stuck, it was later revealed that this was also the
name of Jacob Dean’s 12 year old sister, after this the innuendos came thick and
fast. Fajitas were for dinner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/summer-tour-2011/images/2.jpg" width="300"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="day-5--rest-day-1"&gt;Day 5 – Rest day 1
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people slept in late this day after some early starts on the previous days.
Everyone except Ali went for a walk along the coast but Ali remained behind to
do a literature review. While walking a large number of naked people were seen,
this was highly disturbing. An old abandoned pill box was found and explored, it
was very hot inside. Finding a small cover everyone sat down and had a lovely
time playing in the water. Murray kicked a rock while swimming and bled all over
the place. Fails annoyed a sea anemone by destroying its home and it got its own
back by stinging Fails, Elliot and Ruth. Since it was Elliot’s last night with us we
had another Chilli to remind him of all the good times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="day-6--sa-gubia-eastern-side"&gt;Day 6 – Sa Gubia, eastern side
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another early start to get to the crag before the sun hit it. The massive walls of
Sa Gubia were on the table for today. Ali and Lisa decided to have a day alone
and headed over to the steep hard world of Fraguel. After quite a long walk in up
a dry river bed the bottom of the wall was reached where we met 2 local
climbers who gave us a lot of tips about which crags not to visit as they had bad
bolts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2 best climbs of the day were
a delicate 6a and an outrageous
6a+ which had some cool tufa
action on it. Ali and Lisa also had a
good day out. The group split in 2
with half heading back to make a
curry for dinner and the others
taking Elliot to the airport for him
to head home early.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="day-7--dws--more-sa-gubia"&gt;Day 7 – DWS &amp;amp; more Sa Gubia
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Murray, Jon, fails, Abi and Ollie
headed over to Cala Sa Nau to try
out a different area. There were a
number of easy climbs, fails
managed a 6b but failed on the
7a. Murray tried the 7a from day 4
but ripped the tip of his finer off
on the sloping crimp. Abi jumped
off the top and made a big splash.
Ella was launched; she was a
much finer vessel than the other group who were at the crag.
The climbers at Sa Gubia tried a number of different things. Tristan and Ruth had
a mini adventure on their 2 pitch multi pitch. Ali and Lisa tried a few hard things
with little success. Since it was a Sunday most shops were closed so there was
not a lot of food to be had. Heavy rain made the road outside the apartments
turn into a small river. Since it was Lisa’s last day she decided to get drunk
instead of packing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="day-8--rest-day-2"&gt;Day 8 – Rest Day 2
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ali got up early to take Lisa to the airport, everyone else stayed in bed for quite a
while. While Ali was sleeping most other people went for a large food shop taking
advantage of Lidl’s cheap prices. After the shop everyone moved to the beach to
enjoy the Mallorca sun. The slack line was put up and everyone had a good go
with various levels of susses, this attracted many tourists who took&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;photos, if a hat had been left out we probably would have made some money.
Towards the end of the day we moved the slack line to two trees that were much
further apart, right at the limit of how far the slack line could reach. While
tensioning the line we melted a section as there was so much force! This line was
very long and wobbled a lot. Murray and Tristan both got about half way on it but
nobody made it the whole length. Some people were scared off by the height of
the line but the soft sand gave a good landing and when it sagged in the middle
it was quite close to the floor anyway. While slack lining Fails failed and landed
with one leg either side of the line and had to sit down for a while, see right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/summer-tour-2011/images/3.jpg" width="300"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/summer-tour-2011/images/4.jpg" width="300"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="day-9--the-accident"&gt;Day 9 – The Accident
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ali and Fails headed off to a hard over hanging crag with short boulder like routs.
Everyone else went to Puig St Martin where there was shade all day and easy
climbs. A number of different routes were done. While trying a 5+ with a high first bolt Ollie slipped and hit the ground. He had broken his ankle and mountain
rescue were called to evacuate him. Jon and Murray had both been on the union
run outdoor first aid course which proved very useful. Both tried to check for
broken bones but didn’t feel anything that felt broken, both were carrying first
aid kits but there was little they could do. Four firemen arrived with a stretcher to
carry him out, they were not particularly gentle. Everyone went to visit Ollie that
evening, he was on pain killers at this point and seemed quite merry, fortunately
he had BMC insurance and everything was OK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="day-10--dws"&gt;Day 10 – DWS
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abi decided that she wanted to stay with Ollie for the day and keep him company
as being in a foreign hospital. Everyone else decided to go deep water soloing as
there would be nothing to hit and get hurt on. Ali and Fails went to Cala Barques
and everyone else went to Santanyi. Ali and Fails found their perfect climbs of
steep jug climbing with big powerful moves. The others enjoyed their day and
went to visit the legendary Es Pontas and were surprised by how shallow the
water was there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="day-11--les-perxes-mark-ii"&gt;Day 11 – Les Perxes Mark II
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A permanent problem with Mallorca was trying to find shady crags where the
heat was not too severe. Port Soller had a large amount of shade but we
discovered building works and so couldn’t climb there. Returning to a previously
visit crag is generally avoided on tour but this area has several sections. Ali and
Fails went to the cave and tried more hard things. Everyone else went to the
upper section called Muro de Caimari. There were several hard climbs done by
all. Ruth and Tristan found an extremely pumpy 6b which was very hard. Ollie
was visited in the evening and this time had a large amount of metal in his leg
after the operation and was in for a bad night sleep. After climbing we took Fails
to the airport as he had found a sweet deal and booked an earlier flight home&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="day-12--betlem"&gt;Day 12 – Betlem
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Waking to the sound of heavy rain was not a good start to the day. Almost all the
climbing locations would be soaked and the only things able to be climbed would
be caves. Contrary to the malicious propaganda spread by the Outdoor Club we
did not go to a pub, we went climbing instead. A crag called El Calo de Betlem
was decided upon as it had some shelter and easy cave climbs. Arriving at the
crag to find that rock fax lied and only a part of the routes were dry we soldiered
on. Most people tried a cool looking 6b which had some hard moves in it to a
hidden and now sodden slot. While Abi was on top rope an assisted dyno was
attempted with no result. Another nearby area was investigated but the best
routs were slabs that were still wet and there were serious signs of seepage.
Murray and Ruth checked out an abandoned house which had an aloe vera plant
in front that was about 3m tall and you could stand on its branches/leaves.
Setting up a water line over the pool was discussed at length. We found 2 points
that we felt would be suitable anchors and active spotting near the edges of the
pool was also proposed. Unfortunately it was felt that the 2 anchors were too far apart and a water line was not put up. Instead a raft was built from the many
empty water bottles with an impressively poor result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="day-13--home-time"&gt;Day 13 – Home Time
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ali and Abi went back to Les Perxes for Ali to try and finish his route. The top slab
was wet and no route finishing happened. Packing the cars with all of our stuff
took a while and lead to a rather uncomfortable trip to the airport. Both cars had
to be returned empty and so the economy race was on. Murrays diesel had only
had 1 ½ tanks of fuel so was already low but made it to the rental drop of shortly
after the fuel light came on. Ali was forced to put in an extra 5 euros of fuel. At
the airport there was a slight challenge convincing the staff that Ollie couldn’t
walk and that he needed a wheel chair. After a large amount of repacking to get
everyone under the weight limit we all ate and drank as much as we could to get
as heavy as possible to reduce the fuel economy of the plane to restore Ryanair’s
karma. Arriving late at Stansted we were all greeted by an enormous line for
border control with some grumpy staff who were extremely unhelpful. We retried
our bags and then all went our separate ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="day-1-15th-september"&gt;Day 1 (15th September):
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flew out to Kos from Gatwick after a 3am start, Lizzie is woken up by a phonecall 10 mins before the
Easybus leaves but somehow makes it in time. From Kos we take taxis to the port, a ferry to
Kalymnos and then a bus to Massouri. Eventually we arrive late on in the afternoon at Babis bar in
Massouri on Kalymnos, our accommodation for the trip. As it was getting dark when we arrived at
the bar we decided to go for a swim in the pool and eat rather than attempting to climb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-2"&gt;Day 2:
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We fafffed with gear/breakfast till 10:15 then headed out to the Poets sector, the closest to Babis
bar. Kip managed to forget his shoes and attempted to Alistair’s size “too small” downturned
bouldering shoes to much hilarity. Kip flashed his first 6a (after going back for shoes) and Ruth did
her first sport lead (5a). Dac lead a 5a that she found “nice” called Pindaros. The bolts on “Sevasti”
(7b) were found to be in silly places which was a shame as the bottom of the route involved
wrestling with an incredible tufa feature. Climbing halted at mid afternoon due to climbing not been
possible in the sun, we decided to wake up early the next day to climb for a greater amount of the
day. At dinner that night Lizzie claimed that she could taste the fennel (despite the herbs not been
fennel) and the phrase “getting involved with” was deemed acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-3"&gt;Day 3:
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Up at 5:30AM! (It was still dark) to beat the daystar at its own game. Breakfast of two eggs and
bread is already getting slightly sickening. Kip took a big fall while clipping on a 6b+ and decided to
sac the rest of the day off. Cheehan found a mobile phone charger and learnt how to belay. Johan
found that the phrase “just bisioning around” annoyed Alistair. Ruth tried a 5b but weighted the
rope due to deficiencies in route finding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-4"&gt;Day 4:
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lisa Beats Kip’s tour fall distance record by falling from the last move of the 40m route Trella (7a).
Johan managed to climb 9 routes in a day with Dak and kip managing 8 as part of a group of 3.
Alistair flashes Trella for his first 7a flash (climbed without falls on first attempt). We had lentils for
tea, they were tasty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-5"&gt;Day 5:
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Babi took the cool kids to a crag that had all day climbing due to the presence of a north face.
Meanwhile red point club (Lisa, Alistair, Cheehan) had a rest day. Johan and Johnny both flashed 6c.
Kip learnt how to tie in with a bowline knot which is quicker to undo than a figure 8. Dak tried a 6c
for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-6"&gt;Day 6:
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rest day for everyone who wasn’t in red point club. Red point club went and red pointed some
more. Everyone else went and hired scooters and became a crazy motorbike gang for the day which
involved going to the supermarket for cheap food and 1.93euro/1.5L wine and riding the mountain
road to Vathy and Pothia. This was the best day of Fresher’s life. Cheehan flashes 7b+ despite
having never lead outside before the trip! And Lisa almost redpoints 7a+. Kip doesn’t hold up well
on the paint stripper wine (methanol content?!) and falls asleep early.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-7"&gt;Day 7:
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fresher and Kip embarked on the first multipitch of the tour at the ‘School’ sector of Kalymnos.
‘Platon’ a five pitch route: 4c, 5a, 5b, 5c, 4b. This was Kip’s first multipitch climb but as the first two
pitches were easy it was decided to simul-climb (leader and second moving together) them for
speed. This was extremely fun and the first two and a half pitches were dispatched in between 5
and 10 minutes, thus showing the speed advantage this style of climbing has. As the climbing
became harder and more technical towards the end of the 5b pitch they switched to belayed
climbing for the end of this pitch and the following pitch with Fresher leading. The final pitch was
lead by Kip with big run outs (big fall potential due to spaced protection) presumably because the
first ascensionist had run out of bolts. The view from the top of the ridge line the climb went up was
pretty spectacular, unfortunately for weight saving we brought no camera. The whole climb took a
surprisingly brief period of time; been dispatched including abseil decent before 1:30pm!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alistair dispatched the route Zorba Le Gros on his 2nd attempt for his first route at the 7b grade. Lisa
falls right from the end of Polipitis (7a+), plans to come back later in the trip to finish it off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-8"&gt;Day 8:
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;More climbing at Poets for most people, Alistair, Cheehan, Jonny &amp;amp; Lizzie head to the impressive
cave of Spartacus where amazing routes and shade until 6pm are found. Cheehan starts work on
Daniboy which at the grade of 8a is harder than any IC student in recent memory has climbed.
Alistair picks the classic line of Spartacus, both routes require painfully jamming your knee in to get a
hands-off rest, plans are made for one of Babis’ hand-towels to become a crucial knee-pad. Jonny
tries Magnetus, a very short and powerful route at the 7c grade. Lizzie starts attempting climbs at
the 6c grade. All four are enthusiastic to return another day to complete their projects. Chris &amp;amp; Lisa
head back to Polipitis, get close but again not quite close enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-9"&gt;Day 9:
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone takes a rest day, Fresher sets off determined to hire a boat. Turns out nobody on Kalymnos
is stupid enough to hire Fresher a boat. Much larking around in the swimming pool happens and not
a lot else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-10"&gt;Day 10:
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psyched after successfully imitating turbo Germans; Fresher and Kip embarked on their second
multipitch climb of the tour. This time on the small island of Telendos (or Telly’d as it became
known) with the objective of climbing a 6b+ overhanging “offwidth” (off width cracks are named as
such because they don’t easily fit human body parts and so lead to a particularly physical form of
climbing).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 7 - Telendos as seen from Kalymnos&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day started at noon with catching the ferry to Telendos due to the climb being north-easterly
facing. Upon leaving the town on Telendos a dog started to follow us. This dog obviously used to
climbers going to the closer crags giving it food proceeded to follow us over very broken terrain for
over an hour and a half to our climb despite our best efforts to turn it back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kip lead the first 6a+ pitch of crimpy Telendos limestone which had a nice unprotected bushy muddy
sloping ledge at the top. Fresher, been the expert in all things disgusting then attempted the 6b+
“offwidth” pitch which turned out to be more of a fist/hand jamming crack. The inside of the crack was made of fossilised shells that hurt a lot. After about 4hrs of pain the “offwidth” pitch was
dispatched. The delay was primarily due to it been impossible to second with a backpack and having
to prussic up a fixed line instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 8 - The notorious offwidth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resting at the top of the 2nd pitch the decision was made to abseil off the climb due to the
encroaching darkness and the “meat” of the climb having been dispatched. In the twilight at the
bottom we found the dog now very dehydrated and so we shared some of our water with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What followed was 3hrs of stumbling through the dark trying to find our way back to the town but
always finding ourselves above a cliff line with an increasingly distressed dog while getting very
dehydrated. Eventually unable to find a way down from the cliff line we abseiled off a sturdy bush
to a low angled scree slope which lead to the shore line path to town. Unfortunately the attempts
to save the dog by making a sling harness for it such that we could take it on the abseil were
unsuccessful (kept wriggling out). So we feared as the dog was scrabbling around in a dangerous
position (top of a loose cliff) it would die. However just as we had given the dog up as lost it came
bounding down the slope towards us, obviously it knew the decent and hadn’t told us. We brought
the dog back to its owner and endeavoured to explain just how lucky a dog it was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this madness went down Johan managed 11 routes in a day on Castalia (good when each day
only has 6hrs of climbing time).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in the realm of the sane, Alistair successfully redpointed Spartacus for his first 7b+ route, the
hand-towel taped to the knee making all the difference. Cheehan fell from near the end of Daniboy
and Jonny was shot down by Magnetus but managed to climb a neighbouring 7b. Chris and Lisa both
managed to redpoint Polipitis for their first 7a+ routes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-12"&gt;Day 12:
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were sufficient funds for all of us to have all you can eat BBQ, as a vegetarian Kip decided to
spend his money on a BIG pizza instead. Certain members hit the all you can drink wine pretty hard
and after a moonlit trip to the beach, are unable to find their own beds so instead settle for sharing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-13"&gt;Day 13:
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cheehan successfully redpointed Daniboy (8a), Johnny and Johan followed suit with Magnetus (7c)
and a 7b getting redpointed respectively. All very good achievements!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-14"&gt;Day 14:
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of us decided to have a rest day and went to Telendos where we hired sea kayaks and went to a
small uninhabited island with a church on (about 2km away). We then had a tasty cheap lunch at a
restaurant on Telendos. For afternoon entertainment most of us swam the 1km from Telendos to
Kalymnos, for many of us our first open water swim. Fresher paddled the dinghy from the swimming
pool at Babis Bar using a slippery when wet sign, a true act of heroism that required reinflation at
the half-way mark. Celebratory ice-cream and beer were consumed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-15-september-29th"&gt;Day 15 (September 29th):
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Return to London via two buses, a ferry and Easyjet. Minor drama with luggage not showing up in
time for Easybus, however Easybus was late so all is well. London is grey, rainy and miserable and
generally inferior to Kalymnos in every respect. Still, Kalymnos has left a big impression upon all of us
and we cannot wait to return in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the above are full-time IC students and members of ICMC. The tour budget projected 15
attendees with 14 being IC students, however the alumni member dropped out, the result was that
15 IC students attended the tour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="financial-breakdown"&gt;Financial Breakdown:
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CSB awarded this tour £463.00 of subsidy which will be split equally between all attendees to
cover travel expenditure when received. The tour broke even. There was not a fixed ticket price as
not everyone came for the duration of the tour, however individual prices were calculated based on
the cost of food + accommodation for the number of nights the attendees were present. The cost of
the tour for a single attendee for the full two weeks once subsidy is received was £400.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="difficulties--objectives"&gt;Difficulties / Objectives:
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tour originally intended to run to Sardinia, however owing to a lack of eligible hire car drivers,
the destination was changed to Kalymnos as it was possible to walk to the climbing from our
accommodation. Changing the destination actually presented very few problems and the new
destination was able to fulfil all of the tour objectives. The cost of the flights increased however this
was offset by the money saved from not needing to hire cars. This also meant that our subsidy
allocation was still valid, the change in destination was cleared with the DPCS well before departure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many new skills were learnt from simul-climbing to new tie-in knots and even just better mental &amp;amp;
physical tactics for attempting a hard route. Not a single member came away from the trip without
increasing the level at which they climbed. Several members lead climbed outdoors for the first
time, this is a major milestone in anyone’s personal climbing development. The well-protected and
enjoyable routes played a major role in this&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alistair Brash&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simon Partridge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tom Coyne&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brigette Atkins&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Jacob Dean&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jonathan Hazell&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-1"&gt;Day 1
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the 10 tour members departing from different airports throughout the country everyone
arrived in Alicante Airport, Spain at roughly the same time (varying between 09:30am and 11am
local time). The first port of call was the car rental station where two hire cars were collected. One
being upgraded two stages for free because they didn&amp;rsquo;t have the booked car, thus providing us with
a 7-seater, dubbed the &amp;ldquo;win-car&amp;rdquo; for the rest of the tour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A (theoretical) hour later with some exploration of the Spanish coast led to everyone arriving in the
first villa of the stay, graciously provided by Joergen. Unloading and lunch ensued then reloading
into the cars and off to the beach to find one of the deep-water-soloing crags mentioned in the
guide-books. After some non-existent right-turns eventually an alternative was found and the fun
began.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For many of our members this was the first time they had been deep-water-soloing, climbing
without ropes above the sea, the day ended with a spot of tombstoning from the top of the cliff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-2"&gt;Day 2
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We traveled the short journey down the coast to Sierra de Toix to climb at a place called Toix TV.
After spending thirty minutes driving around the maze of holiday homes, we finally reached the crag
as it began to pour with rain. Climbing began, regardless, with several routes being lead including a
7a (very hard!) lead by Joergen. After this, Tom set off on a route –accessed via a dodgy rope bridge -
but ended up climbing past the lower-off, resulting in a run out traverse and a scramble to safety!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-3"&gt;Day 3
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We set off to Forrada in search of some quality climbing. Four hours later, after driving through
continuous hairpins, we reached a track described in the guide book as “rough in places”. This was
discovered to be something of an understatement!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The climbing at Forrada was fantastic and turned out to be well worth the journey. At least it was
until the monsoon arrived and forced us to shelter in a cave for the next hour, waiting for the rock to
dry. The heavy downpour turned out to be a daily occurrence and always coincided with Brigette
being stranded halfway up a lead. Joergen and Jacob managed to find some more difficult climbing
in an area sheltered from the storm. One particular route (Starman, 7a+) provided them with
conversation for the rest of the week. The journey back to the villa that evening was considerably
shorter due to the saturated soil which allowed us to ‘mud-plane’ back down the track from the
crag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-4"&gt;Day 4
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/summer-tour-2009/images/1.jpg" width="300"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We headed back to the Sierra de Toix region but this time to Toix Ouest. Once again it rained in the
afternoon (there is a theme here) so we went back to the villa for lunch. The plan for the afternoon
was to head a short distance from the villa to Echo Valley. Unfortunately we got lost and drove half
an hour into the valleys, ending up at a place that wasn’t in the guide book but did come
recommended by a woman in stripy yellow trousers (clearly a climber). The boulderers among the
group made friends with a local man-of -the-crag who showed them the best traverse in the area
whilst chain smoking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-5"&gt;Day 5
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the antics of the previous three days, it was decided we should take a rest day. We had a lazy
morning by the pool followed by some deep water soloing in the afternoon. It was warmer in the sea
than out, so we swam about before coming home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/summer-tour-2009/images/2.jpg" width="300"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/summer-tour-2009/images/3.jpg" width="300"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-6"&gt;Day 6
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was our first trip to Sella (the biggest crag in the area) and we were not disappointed. The
routes were amazing. Tom and Brigette started a multipitch but true to form, when Brigette’s
involved, it began to rain as soon as they had both reached the first belay. After much commotion
and a variety of problems, they both abseiled down to safety. Meanwhile, diehard boulderer, Jacob
gets his head for heights as he takes his first fall whilst leading (after much bullying from Alistair and
Joergen).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fresher took a less active approach to the day and made a hammock at the base of the crag. His
creativity got the better of him later in the day when he attempted to make a zip line into the
swimming pool back at the villa. Fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-7"&gt;Day 7
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We went to Echo Playa and for the first time since the first day, the sun was out. Quickly, we realized
that it was too hot and hoped for mild temperatures once again!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of us went off to do ‘traditional’ climbing, whilst the others climbed sport routes. By lunch
time everyone was far too hot, so we decided to go back to the villa for a siesta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the afternoon, Fresher had a brilliant idea: He built a raft from water bottles and set sail in the
swimming pool. However, his success was short lived as Tom and Jacob bombed him, sinking his
raft!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That night, we moved to a villa in the mountains. Whilst everyone was packing, Fresher managed to
put a large dent in the car. However, he did fix it with his trusty plunger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-8"&gt;Day 8
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jacob, Alistair and Joergen climbed a three pitch route. Joergen, however, left his shoes at home, so
they ended up sharing two pairs between three people, swapping shoes for each pitch. In the
meantime, Charlene and Simon completed their first lead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/summer-tour-2009/images/4.jpg" width="300"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That evening ICMC stormed Benidom! We saw the delights that were on offer, Sticky Vicki, The
Mediteraneun Bar to name but two&amp;hellip; We opted for the beach. Simon and the girls somehow ended
up in the sea, partly clothed and Fresher got buried. ICMC returned home, distinctly weter and
sandier than before and settled down for a nice bowl of carrot curry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/summer-tour-2009/images/5.jpg" width="300"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/summer-tour-2009/images/6.jpg" width="300"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-9"&gt;Day 9
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back to Sierra de Toix again! Spurred on by the previous days multipitch, Fresher, Simon and Brigette
set off on a three pitch excursion. Charlene climbed a route with a rope that was too short to be
lowered off, so had to do some imaginative maneuvers to get down!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By this stage everyone else was bored with Toix and decided to do some more deep-water-soloing,
leaving Fresher and co halfway up their multipitch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-10"&gt;Day 10
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was our last full day of climbing, so we decided to go back to Sella as it was so good before. Tom
and Ed managed to complete the multipitch that they got rained off last time. Charlene and Simon
continued to tick off a number of lead climbs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During late afternoon, there was a massive downpour which resulted in half the group running for
cover and leaving everyone else to pack up all the gear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-11"&gt;Day 11
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last day! The weather was worse than ever, it was raining when we woke up! We packed and
cleaned the house before driving towards Alicante. When we got there it was far too wet to sit on
the beach, so what would a group of university students do in Alicante for a day? Obviously we
found the nearest Toys ’R’Us and set about trying to play with every toy in the shop!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the tour went very well. I would not have made any fundamental changes to the way
it ran, things that could be improved in the future are small organizational things such as being
better at buying the correct amount of food for a large number of people. Financially, the tour broke
even. And a good time was had by all! The only thing that did not go as planned was the fact that it
rained so often! But that being said, we went climbing every day and still had an amazing time.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Bolivia Expedition 2019</title><link>YAYAYA/p/bolivia-expedition-2019/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jul 2003 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>YAYAYA/p/bolivia-expedition-2019/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link" href="YAYAYA/documents/bolivia2019.pdf" &gt;Expedition report&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="forget-your-hands-trust-your-shoes"&gt;&amp;ldquo;Forget your hands. Trust your shoes&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The climbing shoe advert comes back to me as I balance awkwardly on the rockface, a hundred and
twenty feet above the valley floor. If I were more comfortable, I could look behind me to see the
towering limestone cliffs on the other side of the pass that forms the entrance to El Potrero Chico,
Nuevo Leon, Mexico. To my left, the mountains a mile or two away are still shrouded in haze, but
the sun is just peeking over the hills behind me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My feet are on two small ledges, enough to hold me but far from reassuring. My left thumb and
right forefinger are buried deep within small pockets around chest height, and the rest of my fingers
are clinging to the smooth rock, more for psychological than physical support. In the back of my
mind, though, is the vague thought that if my feet slip, I could break both digits quite easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s what I hope is a big hold is about four feet above me, and I should be able to clip into the
next bolt when I reach it. But I&amp;rsquo;m already five feet above the last bolt, which will catch the rope if I
fall, and there&amp;rsquo;s enough slack to ensure that I&amp;rsquo;ll drop about twelve feet before swinging into the rock.
Even on &amp;lsquo;safe&amp;rsquo; sports climbs, where the bolt is permanently fixed into the rock, I&amp;rsquo;ve never quite got
over my fear of falling. As I feel my arms tiring, I try not to imagine the scraping impact onto the
sharp, water-shaped stone. Why didn&amp;rsquo;t I wear a long-sleeved top, despite the thirty-degree heat?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been stood here for perhaps fifteen minutes, trying to figure out how to make the next moves.
My feet are throbbing, and I shift position slightly, looking for better holds. These rock boots are
tight at the best of times and the heat here is making my feet swell, so that taking them off is blissful
relief. But I&amp;rsquo;m glad of the friction that&amp;rsquo;s keeping me on the rock. There&amp;rsquo;s a hint of a pocket about
eight inches above my left foot. I plant my toe into it and stand up, scrabbling for any slight
purchase with my right. Pulling hard on my right finger, I pull out my left thumb and reach up,
curling the tips of my fingers over the illusion of a ledge, then bring my right foot up to a sloping
hold underneath my hand. I&amp;rsquo;m off-balance now, and my left hand aches as I cling to the hold,
carefully extract my right index finger and reach up for something more positive. My short stature
is suddenly a blessing as I rock my weight onto my right foot, leg folded beneath me, pull myself
over the slight bulge and gasp with relief as I sink my left hand into the hold I&amp;rsquo;d seen earlier,
mercifully deep enough to hang from. After a moment&amp;rsquo;s pause to catch my breath and clip my rope
to the bolt, I move on – my position isn&amp;rsquo;t quite comfortable enough to actually rest. The sun&amp;rsquo;s out
properly now, and I can feel the back of my neck warming up. I go through similar moments of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;anguish twice more before I reach the top of the route and relax. I can just summon the energy to
smile in weary achievement before I head back down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, repeat that entire process two, three or more times a day for three weeks (apart from when it
rains, at which point the rock turns dangerously slick). Add in basic but pleasant camping,
spectacular scenery, spicy food, cold beer, linguistic difficulties, a limited supply of books and
many, many games of Hearts, and you&amp;rsquo;re not too far away from a climbing expedition. In this case,
we were in Mexico, so our list of pleasures also included tequila, aggressive invertebrates and cacti.
Big, spiky, painful cacti that infested the higher slopes – but more of them later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sound like fun? It should be pointed out that rock climbers are a strange breed, and the Imperial
College Mountaineering Club are stranger than most (we are Imperial students, after all). Unless
you&amp;rsquo;ve tried it, there&amp;rsquo;s no way that I can convince you that good climbing makes all incidental
hardships fade into the background, and the inherent risk only adds to the exhilaration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the climbing was great. El Potrero Chico is a ring of limestone peaks, thrust up among the
Sierra Madre Oriental, a few miles down the road from Monterrey, Mexico&amp;rsquo;s third city and
industrial heartland. The northern edge of the Potrero (Spanish for corral – a ring of mountains) is
split by a steep-sided pass, where most of the existing climbing has been done. Vast slabs of
limestone, hundreds of feet high and ranked like sharks teeth, form small valleys and canyons on
both sides of the pass.
There are literally hundreds of routes on the various rock faces, and their varied orientations mean
that even in the fierce afternoon sun, there&amp;rsquo;s always something in the shade. The rock itself is
mainly hard carbonates, especially limestone, and is covered with cracks, pockets, flakes and
imperfections that make for varied and challenging climbing. Best of all, the surface of the rock is
rough, without the &amp;lsquo;polished&amp;rsquo; feel of more popular areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With financial help from the Imperial College Exploration Board and the University of London
Union, nine students set off on the long flight to Mexico City at the start of September. Our mission:
to develop new routes in one of the world&amp;rsquo;s most exciting climbing areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mexico City is impossibly huge, and located in arguably the worst possible place to put twenty
million people. On a high plateau, surrounded by a ring of volcanoes (some of which are still
active), the city&amp;rsquo;s air is a thick smog of exhaust fumes from its crowded streets and heavy industry.
There&amp;rsquo;s little in the way of a sewer system, and the whole place stinks. It may be a lively, vibrant&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;metropolis, but we left without regret on an overnight bus for the long journey north to Monterrey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Monterrey turned out to be fairly nice, we wasted little time there, making instead for the
town of Hidalgo and El Potrero Chico. We spent much of our time staying at the Rancho Cerro
Gordo, a campsite ten minutes walk outside the Potrero that catered to the growing numbers of
climbers who come from all over the world to visit the area. The ranch was quiet – September is
just outside the peak winter season – so we more or less took over the tin-roofed pavilion, where the
traditional shower block and kitchen area were joined by some old sofas, a pull-up bar and a
tightrope. There were a couple of spare helmets we could borrow, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ranch was to become our base for the rest of our time there, but we spent a few nights camping
in the Potrero, looking for new crags to develop. We all spent the next two weeks there, before some
people drifted off to see more of the country, specifically the Pacific coast. After the bustle and
grime of the cities, it was great to be out in the country. People were friendly and relaxed, living
was easy, if not spectacularly cheap, and the rock was gorgeous. Even the events of September 11th
seemed a world away – our only contact with the outside world was a Texan radio station and the
occasional trip into Monterrey for a cybercafe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few days acclimatising to the heat and remembering how to climb, we set off into the
wilderness to look for new routes. We camped at the opposite side of the Potrero from the pass, and
set out in small groups to find fresh, unconquered rock. Unfortunately, it looked like said rock was
going to remain unconquered for a while longer. Despite several trips into the bush, towards the
tantalising rock faces we could see in the distance, we never quite managed to find anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problems were twofold. For starters, the approaches to the actual rock were up steep slopes,
covered with vegetation. While this was not at first a problem, the higher we went, the more cacti
we found. I used to think that cacti looked quite nice, but I now regard them with the kind of
venomous hatred usually reserved for the Student Loans Company. Fighting every step of your way
up an often loose slope, and being repeatedly impaled on sharp thorns which are thrust at you from
every direction is not my idea of a pleasant walk in the desert. Clearing a path wasn&amp;rsquo;t an option
either – uprooting cacti is illegal in Mexico. We eventually decided that the pain and blood loss
were too severe, especially since no-one in their right mind would want to make their own way up
to repeat any routes we did manage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other trouble was the rock. We had decided before we left to avoid drilling into the rock to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;place bolts, so would be relying on &amp;rsquo;traditional&amp;rsquo;, hand-placed protection. Although riskier, this
avoids leaving unsightly metal bolts in the rock face, and is generally preferred in Britain.
Unfortunately, limestone does not always lend itself to such practices, and we found few possible
lines which would be safe to climb. A further problem was that the rock was quite loose in places,
and had various plants growing in it elsewhere. At the start of one potential route, the first hold
came away as soon as it was tried. On reflection, we decided that our initial plan was not feasible,
and since we had no bolting equipment to set up sports routes we resigned ourselves to enjoying the
climbs already there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those climbs were spectacular, though. As well as scores of short routes, the Potrero has
spectacular long routes, which can take an entire day to get up and down. One of these is Yankee
Clipper, which climbs up almost a thousand feet to a summit on the west side of the pass. Our
glorious leaders, club President Kevin and Vice President Phil had three attempts on this monster –
twice, they were forced by darkness and rain to abseil down from about halfway. Other memorable
experiences included a rope getting stuck two hundred feet up in the dark, and a thunderstorm that
flooded our sleeping area at one in the morning.
We left the Potrero with mixed feelings. It was a shame to travel halfway across the world and not
achieve our main goal, but we&amp;rsquo;d had a great time, and the experience of fantastic climbing in a new
country had been great. Given the opportunity, I&amp;rsquo;d go back there, but unless you happen to live in
the States it&amp;rsquo;s a long, long way to get there. But the people are nice, the rock&amp;rsquo;s great and Mexico&amp;rsquo;s
pretty civilised by South American standards, so it&amp;rsquo;s well worth considering. For more information,

&lt;p&gt;An all together fantastic trip involving two breaking-in&amp;rsquo;s (don&amp;rsquo;t panic&amp;hellip;someone only climbed
through the windows of a) the caravan and b) the mini bus.) the rather unfair exclusion of a very
authentic and rustic looking ice pick, much to someone&amp;rsquo;s utter dismay&amp;hellip; &amp;hellip;the full novelty of the
mini bus roof rack (inclusive of very useful ladder up the back of the bus to enable a quick and easy
transfer of self from very back of bus to front windscreen preferably of the same mini bus from
which you started from&amp;hellip;if not then the fast flowing motorway below&amp;hellip;) motorcyclists also had the
extra bonus of the back door opening as they would try and pass us on the motorway&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was also the amazing discovery of a &amp;lsquo;bouncy castle&amp;rsquo; in someone&amp;rsquo;s, rather foolishly, unguarded
back garden&amp;hellip;and the shock discovery of a whole live frog!!!! And the same person who discovered
all these amazing things also cunningly managed to turn (by a feat of PURE skill) everything that
she touched black and glittery&amp;hellip; The caravans were fantastic, apart from the cleaning that had to be
done the next morning&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the Saturday&amp;rsquo;s climbing weather was well behaved, giving an excellent days climbing
Sunday was impeded by rain, which also led to fabulous &amp;lsquo;sudden&amp;rsquo; decisions to have &amp;lsquo;rests&amp;rsquo; during
climbs. Coupled with people&amp;rsquo;s sudden and unexplained attraction to the ground. The followed by an
even more spectacular climb back up a steep, muddy, bramble lined walk to the mini bus. The keys
to which had gone on a little adventure all of their own&amp;hellip;
Everyone made it back in one piece, and no one had left and bags anywhere (especially in Beit
Quad&amp;hellip;)&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
