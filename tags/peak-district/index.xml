&lt;p&gt;“One for the history books” can only begin to describe the experience that was Fresher’s Trip 2025. This is a long one, so I have graciously included an abstract for TLDR purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="abstract"&gt;Abstract
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2025 Fresher’s Trip was an eventful blend of climbing, chaos, and mechanical misadventure. Over the course of the trip, twenty-five climbers navigated all the challenges that the weekend had to offer - from shattered minibus windows and rogue fireworks to the infamous Double Meat Junction, midnight creek swims and dangerously competitive boulder-pad wrestling matches. Freshers and veterans alike demonstrated remarkable resilience and creativity, executing improvised window repairs, heroic minibus hill starts and questionable feats of boulder-pad engineering. Despite the obstacles, the trip concluded successfully, with all participants returning to London slightly battered, but immensely entertained and with a renewed sense of ICMC camaraderie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-journey"&gt;The Journey
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We set off on a chilly Friday night, twenty five keen climbers packed into one minibus and two cars, £60 worth of Library Café cakes in hand and a long drive ahead. After a few games of Fireboy and Watergirl (Fig.1), we formulated a game plan. Benedict’s car would pick up Zak and the last few bits of gear from Westway. Isaac’s car would stop off at Wynsee’s house to collect a couple sleeping mats. The minibus would head to the Earl’s Court Tesco Superstore to pick up Jeremy, Arush and the all-important food shop. With the vehicles loaded, 13 wide-eyed freshers aboard and spirits high, we set off for The Peak District - only 45 minutes later than anticipated (Fig.2)!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a promising start. One that lasted approximately 15 minutes, at which point the two cars received word of the weekend’s first misfortune.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-window"&gt;The Window
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The incident occurred deep within the treacherous lanes of the Earl’s Court Tesco Superstore car park at around 19:00. While attempting an ambitiously tight left-hand turn, the minibus made contact with one of the walls and the left passenger window shattered all over poor Seamus (Fig.3,4).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/freshers-trip-2025/images/20251024_180110277_iOS.webp" width="200"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, no one was hurt as a result of the accident and the passengers swiftly evacuated the vehicle. Faced with the possibility of having to cancel the trip, the committee launched into a series of crisis calls to determine the most appropriate course of action. With the Union out of hours, Noah sought counsel from the security team who, after a thorough risk assessment, advised the careful removal of the remaining glass and the strategic application of cardboard and tape. The team got to work with a roll of duct tape, and a dream. They pushed out the glass with surgical precision and neatly taped two pieces of MDF (very kindly donated by Tesco) with binbags sandwiched in between them to the window frame (Fig.5,6).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/freshers-trip-2025/images/IMG_3049.webp" width="200"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The freshers looked on in awe, bewildered by the expert craftsmanship unfolding before them, carried out by Imperial’s finest engineers (Fig.7).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/freshers-trip-2025/images/IMG_0894.webp" width="300"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In no time at all (1 and a half hours), the window was as good as new and the all-important food shop was done (Fig.8,9).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/freshers-trip-2025/images/IMG_4083.webp" width="300"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One last obstacle stood between the team and their grand departure. The contact had critically compromised the door latch, now refusing every attempt from the team to close it. With a few delicate and highly technical manoeuvres (a few body slams), the door finally cooperated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-cars"&gt;The Cars
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isaac’s car collected the sleeping mats and Benedict’s car picked up some gear from Westway - where Isaac executed, quite possibly, the worst parallel park job in ICMC history. By 9pm, everyone was back on track and we set off once again - only 3 hours later than anticipated.
Isaac’s car, feeling somewhat left out of the evening’s excitement, soon stumbled upon a scene of modern chivalry and found itself in the crossfire of a Lime bike fireworks jousting battle. Thanks to Isaac’s skilful handling of the car, no was harmed in spite of Gao’s unfortunately opened passenger window. Fortunately, the window repair services of the minibus team were not necessary on this occasion. They made it to the M1 with the help of Kian’s questionable navigation, but just as Wynsee was recounting Isaac’s impressive mid-firework manoeuvring of the car to Peter, Isaac suddenly slammed on the brakes as to not rear-end the car in front. The gap between the two cars shrank alarmingly but by some miracle, no contact was made and a motorway crash was luckily avoided. It was safe to say we then turned down the music a bit to calm the nerves of a slightly frazzled Isaac.
The two cars met up at the Leicester Forest East Service Station to refuel and to allow Kian to stretch out his poor hip flexors. Benedict’s car did not seem to have any incidents to report. Arnav appreciated the peace so much, he had apparently set off into a slumber several times. After an interesting incident in which Isaac’s car seemingly teleported around the car park (a result of Benedict’s boredom due to his rather uneventful drive and Kian’s cruel betrayal), the two cars set off on the final stretch to Rowsley Village Hall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-adblues-"&gt;The AdBlues :(
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The minibus team on the other hand, continued their impressive streak of misfortune. A warning had popped up on the dashboard: the AdBlue needed refilling, or the minibus would not restart after a certain number of miles. Noah promptly purchased and refilled the AdBlue, but the warning persisted. This would have to be an issue for another day, it was getting late and the priority was to get everyone to the village hall. Travelling through the pitch black, the team discovered that the minibus was severely underqualified to tackle the rolling hills of the Peak District – it was in fact, rolling down them, backwards. On several occasions, the team had to go out and push the minibus to help start it - at one point, leaving Arav sprinting after it, leaping aboard while it was still in motion all while nursing his toe fracture (affectionately named Bendi).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The minibus team finally arrived at Rowsley Village Hall at approximately 2:30am and were welcomed by a lovely platter of cakes and desserts from the Library Café. After trialling several sleeping arrangements (Fig.10,11) to compensate for the shortage of sleeping mats and Isaac insisting that he did not need a sleeping bag (he later regretted this), we all nodded off for an early night (3:30am).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/freshers-trip-2025/images/IMG_0904.webp" width="300"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/freshers-trip-2025/images/IMG_1269.webp" width="300"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
Figure 10: Ethan (L) and Jeremy (R) evaluating the chair-based sleeping arrangement. The approach was ultimately discarded, possibly because of its resemblance to Jeremy’s funeral earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/freshers-trip-2025/images/IMG_0899.webp" width="300"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
Figure 11: Ethan trialling the boulder-pad bed. He maintained that this single-pad arrangement was superior to the traditional two-pad configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-1"&gt;Day 1
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group woke up bright and early (8:30am) to the sweet melody of Free Tibet and the kitchen was swiftly filled with the comforting smells of instant coffee and toast (Fig.12). Many members of the trip tried Biscoff spread for the first time. Notably, Ethan ate about half a tub. Wynsee set up a very efficient eyeliner station (Fig.13) and Noah was churning out several mugs of microwaved porridge for the group to enjoy. Before long, we were fuelled up and ready to climb some rocks at The Roaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/freshers-trip-2025/images/IMG_1832.webp" width="300"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
Figure 13: Wynsee applying eyeliner on Benjamin at the highly optimised eyeliner station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the cars had to wait for about an hour at the crag as once again, the minibus demonstrated its incompetency on the hills. Isaac’s car bravely fended off a parking space for the minibus as they desperately tracked its location. They noticed the minibus had stopped in its tracks. Once again, the minibus team had had to push it up the hills (Fig.14) and Arav recreated his dramatic leap (much to the dismay of Bendi).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/freshers-trip-2025/images/freshers%20photo%201.webp" width="300"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
Figure 14: Ethan, Arav, Arush, Olaf, Vasily and Benjamin pushing the minibus up the hills on the way to the crag. Arav running after the minibus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the verge of a breakdown due to the AdBlue issue, the minibus frantically drove past the space that Isaac’s car had defended and found a more accessible parking space – this would turn out to be an unfortunate mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-roaches"&gt;The Roaches
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally at the crag, we got some climbing in! A big group were climbing “Greener Traverse” (f5+) and “The Greener Traverse” (f6b) (Fig.15).

&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/freshers-trip-2025/images/IMG_3057.webp" width="300"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
Arush, Mickey, Benedict and Louis tried “Stretch and Mantle” (f6C) and “Undercut Dyno” (f7B) (Fig.16).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/freshers-trip-2025/images/IMG_4269.webp" width="300"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
Figure 16: “Stretch and Mantle” (f6C).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaac, Kian, Shu, Quynh, Mickey and Wynsee found a fun slab to try (Fig.17,18).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/freshers-trip-2025/images/IMG_4254.webp" width="300"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
Figure 17: Isaac standing on basically nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figure 18: Mickey taking a selfie. Kian on the slab with Isaac, Shu and Quynh (L-R) looking on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeremy and Benjamin set up a toprope on “Yong” (HVD 4a) - apparently not very well as later discovered by Isaac (Fig.19).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/freshers-trip-2025/images/IMG_1845.webp" width="300"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
Figure 19: Isaac at the top of “Yong” (HVD 4a), inspecting the anchor and discovering that both carabiners were unlocked and one of the gates were open.
Jeremy and Benjamin also completed “Guano Gully” (S 4b) where some impressive spotting by Jeremy saved Benjamin from a nasty 3m ground fall (Fig.20).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/freshers-trip-2025/images/IMG_8205.webp" width="300"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/freshers-trip-2025/images/IMG_41641.webp" width="300"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
Figure 20: Benjamin at the top of “Guano Gully” (S 4b) relatively unscathed from his 3m fall thanks to Jeremy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaac set up his slackline (Fig.21) and Ethan completed his very first roped climb (Yong on toprope) with the help of Arush and Wynsee singing Gracie Abrams for encouragement (Fig.22). His send was closely followed by sends from Claire, Toby, Oscar and Arnav.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/freshers-trip-2025/images/IMG_4293.webp" width="300"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
Figure 22: Ethan on his first ever roped climb (Yong on toprope)!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ethan had a delicious triple decker bread sandwich (no water) for lunch while spooning Arav to tick off 2 squares from the Fresher’s Trip Bingo (Fig.23,24).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/freshers-trip-2025/images/IMG_4132.webp" width="300"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
Figure 24: The Fresher’s Trip 2025 Bingo. Disappointingly, only 7 challenges were completed this trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Down at the road, the glorified wheelie bin (the minibus) was throwing yet another tantrum. The AdBlue problem that was once deemed an issue for another day had now become a much more pressing issue with the minibus now refusing to start. Noah called a mechanic who confirmed that the minibus would have to get towed back to the village hall (Fig.25).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/freshers-trip-2025/images/IMG_8229.webp" width="300"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
Figure 25: The minibus about to get towed away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless, spirits were still high. With the help of Louis, Benedict completed his first trad lead “Raven Rock Gully” (D) which he affectionately nicknamed “stinky crack” (Fig.26).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/freshers-trip-2025/images/IMG_20251025_180945645_HDR.webp" width="300"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
Figure 26: Benedict after his first trad lead, &amp;ldquo;Raven Rock Gully” (D) aka “stinky crack”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arush, Toby, Oscar, Olaf, Ethan and Vasily went to the upper tier to try some boulders (Fig.27).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/freshers-trip-2025/images/IMG_1851.webp" width="300"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
Figure 27: Some sunset bouldering at the Upper Tier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quynh went on a wander around the crag and at sunset, Vasily, Ethan, Wynsee and Toby walked to a nearby highpoint that overlooked the beautiful scenery (Fig.28,29,30). Oscar, Jonathan, Shu and Claire were getting in their final climbs for the day (Fig .31).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/freshers-trip-2025/images/WhatsApp%20Image%202025-10-26%20at%2023.06.45_7812956e.webp" width="300"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
Figure 31: Oscar, Claire, Shu and Jonathan (L-R) watching someone (Ethan?) on a toprope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sun was rapidly setting and it was home time. With the minibus now broken down, the committee had to improvise another plan to get everyone and all the gear back to the village hall. Noah sent 5 freshers (+ Seamus) off with the mechanic - no committee member required (?!) (they all made it back though) while Isaac ferried another five in his car. The last few people made it down from the crag and Ethan deemed his successful jumpscare Benjamin, Gao and Wynsee worth the rashes he got from the bush he was hiding in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="freshers-dinner-and-initiations"&gt;Fresher’s Dinner and Initiations
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the help of Benedict and a few Ubers, we made it back to the village hall and the freshers began preparing a hearty veggie chilli for dinner (Fig.32). We soon learnt that the minibus had received a delightful £70 parking ticket at The Roaches (Fig.33). Given the circumstances (breaking down), there was not much Noah could have done. The good news was that the freshers had finished cooking a very impressive meal that we enjoyed before the ICMC initiations began (Fig.34).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/freshers-trip-2025/images/IMG_4177.webp" width="300"&gt;

Jeremy and Arush cooked up the all-important Freaky Bru (Fig.35) and we began to set up the stage for the Boulder Pad Wrestling tournament where some very impressive matches ensued (Fig.36).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FINAL: Isaac&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FINAL: Vasily&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
Figure 36: Boulder-pad wrestling in action: Olaf V Jeremy. Seamus diligently spotting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notable matches include Seamus and Jeremy’s in which VAR had to be consulted, Seamus managed to take Jeremy’s sock off less than half a second before Jeremy could return the favour (Fig.37).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/freshers-trip-2025/images/freshers%20photo%206.webp" width="300"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
Figure 37: The audience immensely entertained by Seamus and Jeremy’s incredibly close match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ethan and Wynsee’s match lasted approximately 6 seconds and ended in a concussion after Ethan decided to run straight at me. Unsurprisingly, I flew across the hall and smashed my head into the ground (Fig.38). I would argue this was a DNF as Ethan did not remove my sock, the others maintain this was a KO.
Either way, the lessons learned are: don’t body slam into someone half your weight and wear a helmet if you are going to boulder-pad wrestle Ethan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vasily and Isaac made it to the finals after some upsets knocked out the favourites (Benedict, Seamus and Ethan) (Fig.39). Helmets were adopted for this match after Wynsee’s unfortunate accident. Vasily fought valiantly for the honour of the freshers, but a well-timed tactical manoeuvre from Isaac secured him an early advantage. After a fiercely intense battle, both of Vasily’s socks had been removed (Fig.40) and Isaac emerged victorious as the 2025 Boulder-Pad Wrestling Champion (Fig.41).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ethan, Arav, Louis and Benedict played the sling game while a few others attempted climbing over and under the tables where we saw some impressive sends (Fig.42). The term “The Olaf Method” was coined to describe an awkward and slightly painful head-first beta. Louis completed a very impressive nonsight of 4 consecutive tables, thanks in part to Jeremy accidentally pouring cider into his eyes mid-climb (Fig.43).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The night ended with a leisurely midnight stroll and stargazing around the village (Fig.44). Despite the committee’s strong words of caution, Louis went for a chilly dip in the nearby creek. Jeremy and Arush may or may not have given him one too many mid-climb sips of cider. Louis made it out of the creek, slightly more sober than before (maybe not) and everyone finally headed off to bed an entire hour earlier than the night previous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id="day-2"&gt;Day 2
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Day 2 started very similarly to Day 1. Everyone was awoken by the blasting of Free Tibet, and we headed to the kitchen for coffee, toast and Kian’s porridge. Benjamin found the binbags that he had convinced Wynsee were in the minibus (they were in his bag) and the group got to cleaning up the hall. Louis, Wynsee and Seamus spent about 20 minutes scraping burnt rice and oats off the bottom of the pots (Fig.45) but before long, everything was packed up into the vehicles and we headed off to Froggatt for another day of climbing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/freshers-trip-2025/images/IMG_4244.webp" width="300"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
Figure 45: Louis engaged in the delicate process of oat removal, employing state-of-the-art pot-scraping equipment (spoon).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The minibus had stopped once again as Noah was about to park on the road (Fig.46). Louis stationed himself on the side of the road to direct traffic and the minibus team got out one last time to push. As we began unloading the gear, it started raining and it was getting heavier by the minute. Any hope of climbing was quickly dwindling and yet again, the committee had to improvise another plan. There were talks of going to the pub being thrown around but eventually, we settled on heading to The Foundry Climbing Gym in Sheffield (not beating the plastic princess allegations).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/freshers-trip-2025/images/freshers%20photo%2012.webp" width="300"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
Figure 46: The extensive queue of vehicles that formed behind the minibus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kian’s questionable navigation resulted in Isaac’s car doing several circles around The Foundry Gym before finally finding the entrance and discovering that Kian’s questionable navigation had led their car to The Foundry (weightlifting) Gym and not the climbing gym (Fig.47). After a lunch stop, we all made it to the (climbing) gym (Fig.48). The most notable send from this excursion was Zak’s indoor E3 on toprope! Benjamin discovered that you could not place gear into the cracks and thus lost his pizza bet with Jeremy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="the-double-meat-junction"&gt;The Double Meat Junction
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final stop on this trip would be to Loughborough for the annual ICMC Fresher’s Trip Double Meat Junction tradition. 4 brave ICMC freshers (Oscar, Arnav, Kian and Ethan) took it upon themselves to attempt the formidable challenge of eating two large Meat Junction Pizzas within an hour to write themselves into ICMC history. Isaac, the sole 2024 champion, and indeed the only current champion in ICMC, strategically tapped out on the grounds that he still had about four hours of driving left to do.
Oscar was off to a strong start, finishing one and a half pizzas in just 18 minutes. Ethan was off to an even stronger start, completing the same feat in only 10 minutes - though the rest of his car remained unconvinced by his strategy of leaving the crusts until the end. Arnav polished off his first pizza in 15 minutes and Kian maintained a steady, methodical pace. Conversely, Oscar and Ethan began to slow dramatically, each with half a pizza remaining (Fig.49).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/freshers-trip-2025/images/freshers%20photo%2016.webp" width="300"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
Figure 49: Kian (L) and Ethan (R) during their attempts of The Double Meat Junction. Kian can be seen multitasking as Isaac’s navigator.
Amongst the drama of The Double Meat Junction, the expertly crafted MDF window was beginning to lose its structural integrity. With no more duct tape to secure the MDF, the minibus was at risk of losing its window to the depths of the M1. Leaning a few boulder pads against the window and the hopes and prayers of the 15 passengers would have to suffice to make it back to London (Fig.50).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/freshers-trip-2025/images/IMG_4261.webp" width="300"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
Figure 50: The minibus team reinforcing the structural integrity of the window using bouldering pads.
Back to The Double Meat Junction, Arnav was the first to tap out with five slices still on his plate. Oscar followed shortly after, bowing out with two slices and a handful of neglected crusts (Fig. 51). A valiant effort from both, but with their failure, all remaining hope of victory passed to Isaac’s car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/freshers-trip-2025/images/IMG_1280.webp" width="300"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/freshers-trip-2025/images/freshers%20photo%2014.webp" width="300"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
Figure 51: Oscar’s remaining slices of pizza and Oscar on his deathbed (he didn’t throw up though!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kian had only a couple of slices remaining, while Ethan faced his biggest challenge: the crusts. Time was running out, and both were visibly struggling. Then, as The Final Countdown played triumphantly in the background, Kian completed The Double Meat Junction in an astonishing 47 minutes (Fig.52). A full five minutes faster than Isaac’s 2024 victory, all while navigating! When asked for a victory speech, he could only manage a burp. As if The Double Meat Junction was not difficult enough, Kian then had a few Squares for dessert. A truly impressive showing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/freshers-trip-2025/images/freshers%20photo%2015.webp" width="300"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
Figure 52: Kian on his final pizza slice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ethan, on the other hand, was well and truly against the clock. With only a few minutes remaining, he faced his final obstacle: a handful of the dreaded crusts - the self-proclaimed worst part of any pizza. In the dying seconds of the final minute and The Final Countdown playing in the background once again, Ethan completed The Double Meat Junction in 59 minutes. Upon his nail-biting victory, he offered a few truly motivational words: “Six, seven” (Fig.53).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/freshers-trip-2025/images/freshers%20photo%2016.webp" width="300"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
Figure 53: Ethan (self-proclaimed pizza hater) gracing the fans with his words of wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so, with sore muscles, full stomachs and one fewer minibus window to our name, we returned to London - a little sleepier, a little more brainrotted and a lot more seasoned in the art of surviving an eventful weekend (Fig.54).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/freshers-trip-2025/images/freshers%20photo%2017.webp" width="300"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
Figure 54: The minibus and all its passengers (only 9 photographed here&amp;hellip;?) safely returned to Beit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, a few words of thank you are in order.
Firstly, a huge thank you to everyone one who came on this trip, you all made this a genuinely unforgettable weekend. Your enthusiasm, despite the mishaps and the rain and cold, was truly inspiring. To everyone new to ICMC this year, I hope this trip gave you a taste of what we’re about and an opportunity to try something new! I hope you stick around and come back for more! Thank you, thank you, thank you to Noah, Isaac and Benedict for driving this weekend, this trip simply would not have been possible without you. Noah, you are a legend for dealing with that metal sh*tbox (Fig.55). And finally, massive thank you to the committee for making this trip happen and dealing with issue after issue. It wasn’t the easiest trip to kick off the year, but we got everyone there and back and even managed some climbing along the way, so that’s a W.&lt;/p&gt;

With Ben on a rogue midterm holiday to Portugal, the command of the trip fell jointly to Ferdie and Ciaran, who are both vying to replace him in the coming AGM. A box of old space wine was found in stores which, along with the poor forecast for Saturday, led to a rather inebriated minibus. I disgraced myself on the bus in ways not suitable for a PG trip report such as this, whilst Fresher George’s nickname was permanently changed to Corridor George after he revisited some of his dinner in the Nelson Arms’ corridor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/peaks-trip-report-march-2020/image1.png" width="500"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once all the bags were in the Pub, Jake and I hatched a secret plan to sneak off to the nearby Black Rocks for some midnight bouldering. For some reason I was convinced it would be dry, despite the pouring rain that had only just stopped. My disappointment in finding the rock dripping was quelled by the sights of some mega-classic climbs. The combination of being moodily lit from below by headtorches and the excessive amount of port that had been consumed made Gaia (E8 6c) look unreasonably intimidating. By now, everyone else had joined us, and Anna agreed to try leading it next year if she is VP. We all returned to the pub with immense psych for Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/peaks-trip-report-march-2020/image2.png" width="500"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The boozy bus took its toll on everyone come the morning. This was alleviated by a pancake breakfast. Miguel’s French ancestors would be turning in their graves at his scrambled crêpes, however Anna stepped up and corrected the pancakes, which were then perfected by myself by topping it with golden syrup and sugar. My sugar free lent was not going well. The destination for the day was Stanage (which I have run out of funny ways to say is really good). Expecting a soggy hike, we were all surprised to see the crag was mostly dry. Luckily it was so cold that the rain throughout the day froze to hail before hitting the ground, keeping the rock dry, and the wind up the crag prevented most of the rain from even landing. This wind did cause a few false starts with Jake and Ciaran sensibly backing off routes when the hail started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/peaks-trip-report-march-2020/image3.png" width="500"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the hail Corridor George soldiered on and led his first ever trad route, Heaven Crac (VDiff), perhaps cementing his claim to the Keenest Fresher award? Spurred on, Ciaran led the hilarious BAWs Crawl (HVS 5a), which involves inserting yourself into the crag. Psych for trad was low, so most people bouldered for the rest of the day. Dom had the most successful day, sending The Green Traverse (f7a) and Deliverance (f7b+), earning himself the alias: ‘The Dominator’. He proceeded to tell everyone that he had done Deliverance several times, giving credence to the intrinsic hatred for boulderers present in all sentient life. A lack of height proved troublesome for Anna on Thin Slab (f6B) when she couldn’t reach the top from the last existent footholds. Faced with a dyno from no positive hands and after 5 minutes of contemplation, she finally went for it, and ended up in A&amp;amp;E with a very swollen ankle. This marked the end of the day’s climbing, after which we returned to the pub all completely knackered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/peaks-trip-report-march-2020/image4.png" width="500"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A decent dinner and an early night were followed by an early morning and significantly worse than decent breakfast. That being said, the fact that no one ate it allowed us to get on the bus and to the crag quicker. With a clear forecast, we ventured to Froggatt for a day of new milestones. Jake managed to lead Tody’s Wall (HVS 5a) after a great deal of dithering before, during and after the route. This, despite being soft as shit, was his first proper HVS. Izzy meanwhile lead her first HS (Sunset Crack) and Corridor George did the very popular Heather Wall (HVD 3c). It was on this day that Miguel realised that sport climbing is a contrived European exercise in imperfection, and learned to embrace the art of trad, leading a HS offwidth with few enough big cams to make it slightly spicy (probably a Nando’s Lemon and Herb).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/peaks-trip-report-march-2020/image5.png" width="500"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ciaran and I both did Chequers Buttress (HVS 5a), a picturesque route that can be seen on my Instagram (@oliver_tippett (Neil Gresham follows me)), and Sunset Slab (HVS 4b). On the latter we both placed pointless low gear and led the route, even though it is effectively a solo because safety always comes first on ICMC trips. The boulderers spent the day taking pictures of themselves pulling onto impressive looking blocs that they couldn’t get anywhere near sending. This was to be expected as boulderers all love themselves far too much. They did all get some real bouldering done as well apparently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="YAYAYA/p/peaks-trip-report-march-2020/image6.png" width="500"&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a full-on weekend of climbing came the minibus back to London, via the illustrious Pizzeria Loughborough. This time it was Filip’s turn to attempt the third ascent of the double meat junction. His attempt was valiant, yet ultimately ended in defeat after his pizza was pried from his hands for requesting a chunder bucket. No doubt he would have carried on eating until either great success, or great failure. He has since said we will be back to finish what he started, next time with half a bottle of vodka to help. All in all this was a trip that bodes well for next year in the ICMC and proves that we really don’t need Ben (you can stay in Portugal).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first ICMC trip of the decade was to the hallowed gritstone crags of the peak district, and it was mega. Hopes were low when we arrived at The Nelson Arms on Friday evening, with drizzle making any climbing over the weekend look unlikely. Nevertheless, Ed managed to convince Ben to get everyone up before the sun had even risen in hope of getting a full day of climbing. Such a move is unprecedented in recent ICMC history, and perhaps marks the start of a new era of climbing hard (and possibly even eating lard?). Over the course of the previous week I had also been pestering Ben to take us to Millstone, an old gritstone quarry famous for its cracks and arêtes. Ben didn’t need much convincing, fresh from tearing up the Westway crack every Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On arriving at Millstone, we were surprised to find it relatively dry. We were even more surprised to find an almost new big purple Black Diamond Camalot overcammed halfway up a VS offwidth. Ciaran was fastest to set up an abseil onto it and got to work trying to get it out. It took him almost 2 hours to get it, breaking a nut key in the process, but at last he claimed it. Whilst was doing this, everyone else got climbing. Mike Chan, who had driven down from Edinburgh the night before, banished any illusion of fatigue by warming up on Regent’s Street (E2 5c). At the same time Jake, Stu, Martha and I were shamefully doing some bouldering. Technical Master (f6b+) went down for Ciaran, Anna, Mike and me over the course of the day. After this the real climbing began, sort of. Jake immediately got shut down by the “polished and shit” classic Embankment 1 (VS 4c), barely making it off the ground. I then dogged my way up Embankment 3 (E1 5b) and Anna also dogged up the much easier Embankment 4 (E1 5b). Ben had a good attempt of seconding up Embankment 3, before struggling to get his sausage fingers into the pin scars. Apparently ICMC doesn’t do well on cracks without the ice axes. Although no one could feel their hands due to the cold, somehow the pain of finger jamming could still be felt as much as, if not more than usual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our fortunes turned after Lunch however, with Ciaran and Ed leading the super classic Great North Road (HVS 5a), Anna managing to do Embankment 3, and Ed and Ben teaching trad to the less experienced people by setting up practice leads on top rope. Mike produced one of the scarier leads of the trip. When he latched the top of Tea for Two (E4 6a), he was facing a monster fall of at least 10m if he failed to negotiate the crux. Ben and Jake were looking on seemingly more scared than Mike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martha had a nice nap on a bouldering pad, and might have put her shoes on once, but no one saw. It was Burn’s night that evening, so we had an authentic Scottish meal of haggis, neaps and taties. Ciaran even addressed the haggis before we ate it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second day was the antithesis of the first. We knew it would piss with rain most of the day, and somehow Anna managed to convince Ben to take us to the half falling apart, half underwater, 100% nails sport crag called Rubicon. I thought it sacrilegious to go to a limestone crag whilst in the peaks, and my fears were realised when we saw that most of the climbs had deep pits of mud underneath them. No pit of mud was as deep as the one underneath Rubicon (F7a), the classic of the crag. Hanging belays just above the ground were discussed as options to prevent climbing shoes being covered in mud, but eventually a rope bag was sacrificed. Anna was the first to attempt it, easily negotiating the 4m to the first bolt above the safety net of the mud, however couldn’t get the clean lead due to reachy moves on damp holds. Ed, Martha and Stu all had similar experiences on it, but all got to the top. The others who were inspired enough to put their shoes on by the choss worked on a f6b+ boulder, which was done by Anna, Ben and Jake. Ciaran spent all his energy working it out, but his heavy day of pulling on the stuck cam yesterday left him unable to get it before a wet streak reached the crucial holds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For everyone else it was a day of less than productive activities. That being said two interesting games did come out of it. Firstly, dynamic nut placements were practiced by Ciaran and me, with Jake’s nuts. After about 10 minutes of jumping and at full stretch swinging the nut at the placement, we had got it in and we weren’t going to get it out again, much to Jake’s annoyance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second game will go down as a classic of ICMC history; ‘Danger Jug’. It was said that the crag wasn’t that bad because ‘you could take home all your favourite holds with you’. This was true for a particularly loose jug low in a cave under Rubicon. We all took turns to do pull ups off the jug, occasionally giving it a wobble or adding an extra person’s weight, until it came off. On the final attempts Ben even wore a helmet over his face to stop it breaking his nose if it came off. The jug has since gone to where all good rock should go; hung up in stores for people to train on for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite all this the greatest achievement happened on the way home, with Jake managing to finish two meat junctions on his first attempt. Such a feat calls into question the possibility of the audacious triple meat junction. For sure this is one of the last great problems of life, and would bring worldwide attention to that most famous Loughborough institution.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Fresher's trip 2012</title><link>YAYAYA/p/freshers-trip-2012/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Oct 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>YAYAYA/p/freshers-trip-2012/</guid><description>&lt;img src="YAYAYA/YAYAYA/p/freshers-trip-2012/images/0.png" alt="Featured image of post Fresher's trip 2012" /&gt;&lt;h2 id="journey-to-the-peak-district"&gt;Journey to the Peak District
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year’s fresher’s trip was another record breaker for number of members attending, 3 full
minibuses and a car were required with many former members meeting us in the Peak District.
Preparations for the trip were impressive with Joel organising a visit to Costco to buy vast quantities
of cheap food before the trip which saved considerable amounts of money, so much so that we saw
the return of bacon to ICMC. Loading of the 3 buses began at about 4 which allowed for departure
before 6 for one of the buses and the other 2 were on the road before 7. The car driver was last to
arrive and picked up the remaining people. The usual argument of the best way out of London
ensued with everyone apparently taking different routes to eventually get to the M1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heading north on the M1 was exceedingly boring this year with no major incidents resulting in an
early arrival at the village hall. The bus driven by Murray and Caroline (and not Fails) had been given
2 different sets of directions on how to get to the hall, one by Joel which directed them to Derby and
one set by Kip which directed them to the village hall. The directions from Kip were chosen so as it
was suspected that Joel just wanted everyone to go to Derby again. Arriving at the village hall, it was
discovered that the minibus which left first had arrived first and gone to the pub after shotgunning
all the matts to sleep on, the car had also arrived ages before due to not being limited to 100kph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After letting the freshers stretch their legs a bit and play with some of the toys left in the village hall
by other users they were put to bed by Joel who then retired to a private room with Stefan. Several
freshers were fighting over who gets to sleep on the bouldering pads. This was allowed to continue
until a winner was decided at which point an older member went over and informed them that
sleeping on the pads was banned as it damages them. Freshers were sad until they were given a roll
mat, all of which had been taken out the bus this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-1--froggatt-edge"&gt;Day 1 – Froggatt Edge
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joel and Stefan were first up in the morning
and spent an hour cooking bacon and eggs for
people before waking everyone else up. Joel
was enjoying the opportunity to model his
ICMC braded clothing in the kitchen which
looked fabulous. Once breakfast was ready
everyone got out of their sleeping bags very
quickly only to discover an unreasonable
bread ration was being enforced of only 4
Green eggs and ham
slices per day. Unfortunately Joel’s clothing
clashed with the peculiarly coloured eggs, it
seemed that Joel had bought the eggs rather a
while ago and they were not the expected
colour. The green eggs and ham were still eaten
by many to make up for the shortages of other
food. Loading the bus was another faff with
people getting confused about which bus they
were getting on. The first bus to leave left with
an empty seat as they didn’t wait for everyone
but karma caught up with them as they took the
trap signpost to the village instead of the crag
and lost their time advantage. Fortunately the
car had a spare seat so nobody was left behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaving first with all the equipment meant the
first bus also had lots of fun caring everything to
the crag while those who were last to arrive
didn’t have to carry must at all. Amusing antics
by the other 2 minibuses mean’t the first bus
was also completely blocked in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking 50 people to a crag, even one as large as
Frogatt would be a silly idea and would probably
upset the locals, so half the trip carried on along
the path to Curbar and Trackside. This venture
was all bouldering and many boulders were
climbed on. The people remaining at Froggatt all
went trad climbing in groups of 3 which had
been pre-allocated by Joel, another
improvement on last years trip. However due
this did cause some upset members who wanted
to climb with their friends and those who
wanted good belayers for harder climbs later in
the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially many easy climbs were done to let the
new climbers get up a few things. No top ropes
were set up by ICMC at all meaning that there
was no route hogging which so many people get
upset by. Additionally we avoided some of the 3
star classics as there tends to be a big queue for
them and we didn’t want to add to this. There
were 4 other university groups there as well
which caused some confusion due to mistaken
identity. One of the groups was from&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loughbourgh and had previously been
encountered in Fontainebleau, the
notorious “Rapey Dave” was
rumoured to be at the crag but was
not found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joel enjoyed the ultra-classic Toddy’s
Wall (HVS) which it’s ridiculous cock
over and overall outstanding quality. 2
ascents of three Pebble Slab (HVS)
were attempted by Ben and Murray
with Ben asking for a rope to be
rescued and Murray manning up and
finishing it. Tom climbed another
mega classic called Chequers Buttress
after camping at the bottom for 5
other people to go up it. Kip climbed
his first E1 Strapiombante which was
incredibly pumpy and no other clean
ascents were made, even by his
second. Murray did try it but fell
off/pusseyed out on the last move.
Kips victory is in addition to using his
band new aliens which did not
explode when used which is an
impressive feet in its own right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not everyone had such a productive
day out. Andy fell off one of his climbs
during the crux and managed to rip
out 2 pieces of gear, one came out
because the rock exploded.
Fortunately he had been placing many
pieces of good gear before this point
so only had a small fall. Other people
at the crag who are in no way
affiliated with ICMC faired much
worse. One person managed to kick
out his gear on an E2 and then almost
hit the deck. While a different person
fell off of the extremely run out
Browns Eliminate which has gear just
below half height, he inverted and hit the floor. The guy’s helmet took the impact and was
destroyed, but this took all of the force and he was fine. A number of other groups set up top ropes
of classic climbs and then dogged up them polishing the holds a little more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was decided that once the sun started to set it was probably time to leave the crag. After packing
up and picking up everybody else’s litter people headed back to the bus. Older members had head
torches as they knew that we never leave the crag until it’s too dark to see and they helped
everybody else back to the bus. Returning to the village hall dinner was started, learning from last
year it was cooked in several small batches. A few beers were had by most people and silly antics
ensued. Joel and Murray decided to play a game involving a rope, they both ended up half naked
with Joel using his thighs to squeeze Murray’s head so his sock could be removed. Eventually people
headed to bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-2--stannage-edge"&gt;Day 2 – Stannage Edge
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again Joel and Stefan got up early to
cook breakfast for everyone. More
issues ensued with the eggs as it
became apparent that some of the
eggs were a bit more red than might
be expected, after being reminded
that eggs are essentially chicken
periods everyone decided to eat them
anyway. Packing up everyone’s stuff
and leaving the hall was also a speedy
affair meaning that we got to the crag
very early. People ran off to do different things all along Stannage. As a regular club place to visit
many people had projects and climbs on their tick lists that they wanted to get done. There was a lot
more easy bouldering than the previous day so many of the freshers had a go at that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ali and Murray spent a while trying to do Deliverance, Ali had spent many a day falling off the
impressive dyno and spent much of this day doing the same. Lizzie climbed both the left and right
unconquerables (E1 and HVS respectively), Murray wanted to climb these as well but pulled a
tendon in his elbow so decided not to. Ben crushed some E2 climbs and many other routes were
done by people. The day was a bit warm for particularly hard climbs as the friction gets worse with
heat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martin had a minor accident while bouldering, he jumped off a climb but there was a small rock
under the bouldering pad which resulted in a twisted ankle. First aid was given and this opportunity
was taken to crack out the ICMC SAM splints which made the injury look much more severe than it
was. Murray gave his professional diagnosis of “defiantly not broken” which will hopefully break his
100% rate of incorrect diagnosis. Martin was helped home by Amy and the two of them were given
places in the car so that they could get back to London earlier and be dropped home to avoid any
need to walk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joel started getting everyone to pack up and head to the bus at 4 o’clock. This was considered very
early by a number of older members, particularly 3 ex-presidents and Fresher who decided to stage
a mutiny. Unfortunately 3 out of the 4 people on the mutiny were not taking the buses back to
London so noting really happened as a result of this. There was some considerable debate amongst
members as to which bus they wanted to go home in and with which drivers. Eventually the
unpopular driver was put in the unpopular bus and filled with people who were unaware of the
reasons for them being unpopular; fortunately no incidents occurred on the way home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the journey home each bus stopped at the Pizza place in Loughborough arriving just as the
previous bus was finishing so the pizza place was not totally overwhelmed. During the journey home
BBC Radio 1’s Sunday Surgery was put on to entertain the drivers with other people’s misfortune.
The surgery was rather boring with people mostly complaining about their weight. The final person
to call up was called Mr Baggins-Mendes had a slightly more interesting story about a gay friend who
kept hitting on him. Mr Baggins-Mendes kept refusing the other gentleman’s advances on the
pretence that he was straight however he secretly has feelings for the gentleman but is unsure
about coming out. The Surgery suggested that Me Baggins-Mendes bite the bullet and go for it
however he remained unconvinced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The buses arrived back at the union outrageously early and managed to unpack and get everything
away in time for people to catch the tube home, a rare occasion for an ICMC trip. Overall everyone
seemed to enjoy the trip with many people climbing outside for their first time and several others
doing their best climbing ever. No freshers were recorded missing which is yet another impressive
achievement for the new president.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-journey"&gt;The Journey
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Departure from the union was as swift as could be expected from over 40 people; two mini-buses, a car
and a Landrover. Shopping was completed in the previous afternoon at ASDA to save money. The
metal bus most importantly departed before outdoor club’s (S&amp;amp;G) singular bus.
Despite departure music mainly consisting of Tokyo Drift and Pantera and after some crazy big
mini bus, small gap action onward progress was thwarted on the M1 due to a fatal motorbike accident.
Fortunately we were not involved in this so after a mere 4hr delay the speedy 62mph limited metal bus
continued to tear it down the motorway. We arrived at the hall in Middleton at 3AM which
considerably impacted on the psyche for any fun that night and we quickly went to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-1"&gt;Day 1
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We headed for Lawrencefield/Millstone and the boulders to secret garden, along the way we asked for
directions and played some more metal. At Lawrencefield Eliot jumped on Austin’s Variation (VS) and
promptly took a &amp;gt;5M lob narrowly missing a ledge. Meanwhile the fresher’s had good safe fun
seconding routes from VDiff to HVS. Johnny tried Billy Whizz (E2) and fell off a few times on the crux.
Lisa tried Suspense (E2) and fell off, doing it in the end. Kip tried Meringue (HVS) until realizing just how
little gear there was.
The Boulders by all accounts had a fun time at Secret Garden and Cheehan did a V6, V7 and V9.
At Millstone Fresher taught Kip and Dak to Jam (thanks Fresher). Fresher Got his big cam stuck in
Crewcut for a while in his enthusiasm to practice offwidth technique. Others climbed big stuff at
millstone and all the boulders got stuck into Technical Master, Chi and Danny finishing it quite easily.
Lisa did embankment 3. Alistair did Great North Road in the dark and rain by head torch; he described it
as “good”.
After climbing we headed back to the hut for chili and the sock game. The metal bus, cementing its
position as the cool bus stopped off for reduced bakery products. After a few hours of crazy sock
wrestling with only minor injuries sustained we headed for bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-2"&gt;Day 2
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After cooked breakfast we headed to Stanage. “V8 “fresher did Deliverance without too much effort;
also Joe Prinold also did Deliverance (V8). Alistair, Chi and Joe did Greens Traverse (V6). Johan did an E
that was defiantly E1. Kip did his first HVS lead after some failed attempts due to difficulties with the
Giant number 6 Cam that had to be shuffled up. It was Corner Crack a charming offwidth thrutchy thing
which was quite enjoyable after half height. Fresher lead the well named Mangler (E1 5c) another
offwidth chimney thing, he liked it, also it was hard. Some fresher’s were taught to lead/lead belay on a
Diff by Lisa and Kip. Other Fresher’s seconded Sarah and learnt to lead belay. The fresher’s that learnt
to lead commented on how much fun it was. Johan encountered a strange fellow desperately looking to
complain about us/university groups in general on the internet; fortunately no one cares about things
said on the internet. The Journey back was uneventful apart from awesome 2 for £8.50 pizzas in
Loughborough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="summary"&gt;Summary
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The weather was great, the climbing was awesome and the pizza was tasty. Despite the traffic Jam
tiredness the fresher’s trip was very fun. Everyone who is considering going on the Fresher’s trip next
year should, it’s unlikely you won’t enjoy yourself. A small note for future trips is to not attempt to drop people off from the bus as London has a horrible one way system that will cause it to take about 3hrs
and it’s faster for everyone to walk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="14102011"&gt;14/10/2011
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Work begins to get the first ever ICMC three minibus trip going in the morning with
Joel, Kip, Murray and others completing an epic food shop. By around 4pm minibuses are in position
outside Beit apart from bus 3 which turns out to be lacking a roof rack. Cue a quick cycling mission
for Ali &amp;amp; Dan to go get a new bus from Charing Cross. Well, the cycling part was quick anyway. On
the upside, by the time they make it back, the other buses are loaded and soon 3 buses and a car are
heading north before 7pm, go efficiency!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the usual arguments about routes out of London and phonecalls en-route to try and determine
who’s “winning”, all the buses make it to the hall by 11:30, Ed Stott’s car scoring an unsurprising
victory owing to lack of speed limiter. Lisa is picked up from Cromford train station by Ed. Turns out
that the key for the hall is not where it’s supposed to be, thankfully access is temporarily gained by
other means. The key eventually arrives, beer is drunk, sleeping arrangements are sorted and
everyone beds down ready for an early start. There is a minor diplomatic incident when older
members discover that the club’s new overlords have removed bacon &amp;amp; sausage from breakfast in
the name of austerity. Forget bank bailouts, this is the front line of the recession right here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Porridge time comes all too soon. It’s lacking in bacon. Egg is abandoned in the name of
efficiency. On the upside, the buses leave in record time owing to lack of the faff of doing a fry-up for 50. Fresher nearly causes a bus-on-bus accident with an outrageous roundabout wrong-lane
overtaking manoeuvre. Ali scores a moral victory by not taking the trap turning for Froggatt and
getting there first. After a bit of a wait for the third bus, everyone reunites at the crag carpark, including Andy and Lizzie who join us at the crag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ben on Tody&amp;rsquo;s Wall (HVS 5a)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those wanting to climb routes were quickly split into groups of
3 with one novice climber per. group whilst the boulderers set
off to explore. On the bouldering front, Ape Drape (6c+) and
Jet Pack (7b / Tom Coyne 6c+) saw many ascents and quite a
few new climbers discovered the joys of Tody’s playground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the trad front Tody’s wall (HVS 5a) sees lots of action with
Lizzie, Ben, Joe and Murray all leading it. Great effort from
Lizzie &amp;amp; Joe in particular as it’s a tricky one for shorter
climbers! It was also Joe’s first HVS! Ali remembered how to
place gear again eventually on a shaky ascent of the brilliant
Brightside (E2 5c). Ben and Tom went on to make short work
of Valkyrie (HVS 5a), Three Pebble Slab (E1 5a) &amp;amp; The Big Crack
(E2 5b), surely the hardest trad climbed by Freshers on a
Freshers’ trip!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the new climbers were getting a feel for climbing
on grit and gear placement by seconding older members. After
some teaching in how to place gear, lots of first leads were
done with Gamma (VDiff), Slab Recess (Diff), Trapeze (VDiff) and many others all seeing plenty of
attention. I didn’t get to see everyone who did their first leads but well played to Jack and Joel who I did see lead for the first time. Great to see so many people taking their first steps into the world of
trad climbing and loving every minute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, most of the boulderers headed along to Curbar to sample the classic delights of the
Trackside boulder &amp;amp; the Guerrilla Warfare block. Not sure what got done but everyone was pretty
tired by this point. Finally, Tom &amp;amp; Ali managed to scrape a couple of pads together for a ground-up
solo of Oedipus Ring Your Mother (E4 6a). After a few test-jumps from higher and higher followed by
a prompt schooling by a local, both were successful. Respect goes to Tom for dynoing the
penultimate move with feet probably 6 meters from the deck. Ali lanked it but then got his
comeuppance taking a pretty massive fall onto the pads whilst down-climbing back down the route!
As the sun went down, there was a bit more action on Three Pebble Slab (E1 5a). Johan had a
successful lead after a little trepidation, sadly Ruth (kicked her gear out) and Lisa (soloing!) were not
so successful and ended up being thrown top-ropes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back at the hut the evening’s fun and games began (Fresher making an essential beer refuelling run
on the way home). Ruth overcame intoxication in order to rig up the sock game which proved to be
a big hit as usual. As usual, there were no real winners thanks to the winner stays on format but
suffice to say almost everyone tasted the sweet bag wine of failure at some point that night. Murray
then decided to try out bouldering mat sumo which turned out to be entertaining hazardous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Murray promptly proves this statement by injuring his finger during the game. Chilli eventually
arrives (no small task for 50) and is enjoyed by all. Sam turns up at around midnight from York!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="16102011"&gt;16/10/2011
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Day breaks and it’s time for Stanage, the biggest crag in the Peak District. There’s egg
and porridge for breakfast this time but thankfully not at the same time. Everyone packs up and
cleans the hall surprisingly quickly and we’re underway in no time. On the drive, fog around the edge
causes alarm but thankfully upon arrival, the crag is
dry. Lots of people bouldering this time, everyone
enjoying the quality across all the grades that Stanage
Plantation offers. Green traverse (7a) sees lots of
attention as usual. It also sees a lot of frustrating falls
right from the end as ever! A big group gets stuck into
the terrifying delights of Crescent Arete (5+ but
HIGH!) with Tom, Ali, Lisa and Dave all topping out
with only minor psychological scarring!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continuing the highball theme the tall Not To Be
Taken Away (6c) is up next with Tom, Cheehan &amp;amp; Ali
all topping it out. Cheehan goes on to have a very
good day indeed ticking Brad Pitt (7c), Captain Hook
(7b) and Zippy’s Traverse (7a+). In fact most boulders
in the plantation have an in-situ ICMC group on them
with everyone seeming to have a good time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amongst those trad climbing, Joe manages to have a
particularly good day with ascents of the classic Goliath’s Groove (HVS 5a) and Millsom’s Minion (E1 5b – Joe’s first E1). After the success of his first
lead at Froggatt, Jack has less luck on a VDiff at Stanage when he discovers that the finish of the
route is through a hole smaller than he is! Johan does a good looking E1 (can’t remember the name,
sorry) and Fresher gets stuck in some horrible wide cracks like usual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the traditional benightment (finishing climbing in the dark) courtesy of Luca &amp;amp; Tristan it’s time
to begin the long journey home. Even longer for Sam who is dropped off to get a train back to North
Wales – mental! After a couple of hours (and one navigator who seems REALLY keen to go to Derby
rather than the M1) the busses arrive in Loughbrough for the traditional pizza stop. Many Meat
Junctions are consumed and drivers are topped up on caffeine. Sometime around 1am the buses
return to Beit Quad, gear goes back in stores and everyone heads home, tired but hopefully as happy
as I was!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to everyone who came on the trip for making it one of the best we’ve had. Thanks to the
photographers (Pedro, Ed, Jeffrey &amp;amp; Murray) for all the great pictures. Finally, big thanks to all of the
committee who selflessly give up a lot of their time to make trips like this possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope to see all of you soon on another of our trips!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-journey"&gt;The Journey
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Due to ultra efficiency from Johan and the shopping crew the bus was ready to go at 18:05,
unfortunately no one was actually here at this point, mainly due to coursework and lectures.
Departure occurred some 20 minutes later. Most importantly Outdoor Club (S&amp;amp;G) where still
putting bags on their roof as we burnt away from the union. The journey was uneventful apart from
a slight deviation from the planned route around stoke. Eliot’s car and the bus arrived at the
campsite within a few minutes of each other due to the car stopping for ice cream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-1"&gt;Day 1
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fresher and I went to Jamtastic Ramshaw Rocks while everyone else went to the Roaches. I lead
Phallic Crack (S) and Battle of Bulge (VS). On Battle of the Bulge I entertainingly kicked out my first
gear as I moved past it and proceeded to place very suspect runners to the top. I then proceeded to
be a little silly and fail to start the crank, I will return. Fresher the lead a severe crack, finding it
pleasant and jammy.
At the Roaches lots of teaching and fun climbing/bouldering went on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="day-2"&gt;Day 2
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The start was heavily delayed by faff and destination selection but eventually we ended up at the
slightly damp Roaches. Lizze lead the crazy run out VS that Johan had lead the day before. Quite a
few people got stuck into a jamming roof crack boulder problem that Fresher had found, loosing alot
of skin in the process. Top knots were declared the best hair style for jamming. Murray did the hard
move on ‘The Boss’ (f6c) only to fall off the easier upper moves, it was that kind of day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-race"&gt;The Race
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We stopped for take away in Stoke. The food varied from cheap and mostly disgusting (Ali’s) to
quite good pizza with a middling price. At Ali’s a one of the local tramps decided that it was time to
tell everyone which bits of London he had been too (Peckham, Wandsworth and Knightsbridge
apparently).
Further down the motorway we stopped for a toilet break at Harvester only to see Fellwander’s bus
in the car park. Some aggressive driving and loud Tokyo Drift latter they knew that it was on. We
allowed them the start and they continued to pull away from us due to an estimated 0.5Mph speed
advantage on their speed limiter. However roadwork’s with average speed check and some crazy
weaving and shortest path taking put us back ahead. Fellwander’s presumably knowing that we
would just defeat them in London if they managed to get ahead using their speed limiter advantage
bailed onto the M1 and its inevitable congestion.
At the union the entertainment was provided by the door to stores been broken and therefore gear
was left for the night in the bus. Even after all this faff the Fellwanders had still not got back,
presumably they enjoy traffic jams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first thought, it all seems rather mad: piling into a minibus on a cold Friday night, bombing up
the M1 for a couple of hours and then wandering into a field, at midnight, with a torch as your only
light source in which to pitch a tent! Okay, so it is mad, but why not? Oh, and the reason for this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get two awesome days, climbing the gritstone crags of the Peak District. As a relative novice to
the world of rock climbing, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t quite sure what to expect, but just the thought of leaving
London for the weekend was reason enough to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waking up on Saturday morning to the sound of whistling birds rather than rush-hour traffic, with
the crag only a few minutes away, I was convinced I had made the right decision! With all the
banter from more experienced club members about past triumphs and plans for the day, I wondered
if it would be possible to climb anything without looking totally pathetic. The skill of these people,
however, means that one is able to develop at their own pace in a relaxed and safe environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were very lucky as there was no rain all weekend, with the added bonus of sun on Sunday,
making those first moves even more enjoyable! Returning to London on Sunday night, I felt
refreshed, albeit tired, and ready to take on those 9am lectures! It was certainly one of the best
weekends I&amp;rsquo;ve had in two years of being at Imperial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As well as these trips, which are run every other weekend, the club visits a London climbing wall
every Wednesday. This is where I did my first climb, and although outdoor climbing is a different
game to wall climbing, it is an excellent way of seeing what climbing is all about, without the
commitment of a whole weekend away. Climbing walls also help you to improve your technique,
whether you decide to go outdoors or not. So, you feel like having a go? Then just turn up and come
along. We meet at the college climbing wall* (off the walkway, next to STA Travel) on Wednesdays
at 1pm. All you need is yourself (well, and about ten quid!) By about 6pm we tend to leave the wall
and head for a pub somewhere around college for an evening of chatting and relaxation. So, my
advice to anyone getting a bit fed up with daily college life: forget Southside, forget tutorial sheets.
Pack your rucksack and jump in the minibus. Believe me, it&amp;rsquo;s a blast!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*Amendment we now meet outside the union and STA travel no longer exists&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
