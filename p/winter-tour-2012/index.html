After an unusually uneventful drive we arrived early at the accommodation and as such were unequipped to deal with
dinner. An early search party set off in search of takeaway, unfortunately the chip shop was closed,
but further trekking revealed a Tesco’s selling microwave pizzas. There was much rejoicing.</p><p>The next day began with Aviemore’s finest in winter safety instruction, the mighty Kevin, arriving to talk the novices through their first day in the mountains. Meanwhile, the passion wagon, plus Hamzah,
had already packed camp and headed for the snow. The main party followed in hot pursuit, eventually
meeting them in the bottom of the coire. Kevin promptly got the novices running about in the snow
learning the gentlemen’s rules of a snowball fight, how to ice axe arrest, move on ice and snow and
how to judge snow conditions incase they are dangerously yellow. Hamzah, Ruth and Fresher set off
on their siege attempt of Invernookie (III) and Tom, Ben and Kip began what they believed to be
Fingers Ridge (IV) but after Ben spent 2 hours leading a pitch by the seat of his pants it became evident that this was in fact not the case. After a quick reconsideration, the group bravely ran away,
away to Red Gully (III) on the right before the ground steepened and became a crux pitch of what
turned out to Fingers Ridge Direct (VII). The main party reconvened at the car park and headed home
to construct a dish resembling a pasta carbonara and were eventually joined by the Invernookie team.
There was much rejoicing.</p><p>On the second day, Kevin was met at the car park and the novices set off to do their first route, Aladdin’s Couloir (I) and much fun was had. Tom, Ben
and Kip set off to try Aladdin’s mirror direct (IV), with Tom dispatching the
crux ice pitch in his standard visually pleasing manor. Team snow hole +1
went to do the Runnel (II) and, after Hamzah pretended to be a sledge for a
bit, abseiled back down and responsibly had Hamzah checked over by a
mechanic to have the dents beaten out. After it was made apparent that all
was well, chili was consumed by all, and there was much rejoicing.</p><p>Having completed their instruction, it was time for the novices to shed the surly bonds of snow and get on the rock. After a pre dawn walk in and it
becoming apparent that John and Knut are in fact powered by uranium, Tom
and Ben bravely lead two novices each (Knut, Jo, Joel and John) up Hidden
Chimney (III). This was a successful venture with both teams topping out at
around midday. These were soon joined by Kip and Tim (whose name is Tim)
who had successfully lead the Runnel (II) and retrieved the gear and axes left
by the previous days tobogganing. As the weather was so glorious, and the
day was but young, an assent of Cairngorm was devised. Pairs geared up and
battled up the tough 40º incline. Once summited people became happy, then
naked, then happy. Fresher, Hamzah and Ruth had a rest day. There was
much rejoicing.</p><p>Winter skipped spring and summer and became autumn and conditions become unclimbable. A team of elite connoisseurs ventured to the Tomatin distillery car park,
and eventually visitor’s centre. Once all the available
knowledge and whisky had been absorbed a historically
accurate roast dinner of biblical proportion was made and
consumed followed by enough pudding to fill an ant the size
of a house. There was much rejoicing.</p><p>As the weather was still awful, a trip to Newtyle Quarry was commissioned. After some dry tooling and the
invention of the crampon smear and running man
techniques, it was determined that the weather was indeed
awful. The trip bravely ran away, away to the pub. After
some cracking nosh and a pint or two the trip reconvened
back at the house. A game of hide and seek later and diner
was ready. People became hungry, then happy, then full.
The following events that followed were a bit too much like
fun to be mentioned in a Scottish winter report, needless to say that several ventured to Aviemore’s
finest after dinner amusement, The Vault (VI). There was much rejoicing.</p><p>Friday came and still the bad weather persisted. Some people went shopping, then some other people went shopping. Later, after hours of graft, Tim invented the snowball cocktail. Some people watched
TV, someone did some work, some people talked of how they should do work. Eventually a traditional
Christmas dinner of spaghetti bolognaise was eaten and it was time for the ICMC secret Santa. People
became happy, then thankful, then Joel became sad. There was much rejoicing.</p><p>On Sunday we left. There was much rejoicing.</p><script src=/YAYAYA/shortcode-gallery/jquery-3.7.0.min.js></script><script src=/YAYAYA/shortcode-gallery/lazy/jquery.lazy.min.js></script><script
