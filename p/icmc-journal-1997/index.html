A journal of ICMC activity from 1997/98 by Rich Marshall, titled &ldquo;Jammin&rsquo;Crack&rdquo;.
The original cover featured a bra attached to someone&rsquo;s buttocks, and was omitted as a reflection of the change in the club since that era.

Transcription Editorial: I MADE THIS As far as I can deduce this happens to be only the third journal in 29 years, the last being printed in 1974! Amazingly this relic from the past contains stories the traditional last meet of the first tern (Bosigran!), the dinner meet, an expedition in the Bolivian Andes (with 23 routes climbed, some potentially 15 ascents!) and talks by Doug Scott (I" ascent of Everest&rsquo;s north face!) Has the club changed over the years, I ask myself? Well to be honest, NO. There are enough of stories of stopping for &ldquo;spew stops&rdquo; and disappearing off to far flung corners of the globe with union money only to end up drinking and pulling to realise we&rsquo;re probably doing them proud! May it continue!

in 1974! Amazingly this relic from the past contains stories the traditional last meet of the first tern
(Bosigran!), the dinner meet, an expedition in the Bolivian Andes (with 23 routes climbed, some
potentially 15
ascents!) and talks by Doug Scott (I" ascent of Everest&rsquo;s north face!) Has the club changed
over the years, I ask myself? Well to be honest, NO. There are enough of stories of stopping for &ldquo;spew
stops&rdquo; and disappearing off to far flung corners of the globe with union money only to end up drinking
and pulling to realise we&rsquo;re probably doing them proud! May it continue!</p><p>In writing the editorial and having to put the journal together in the first place 16 1S usual to grip
about the hassle and stress of the job. My predecessor described it as &ldquo;one of the lowest orders of the
alhatros&rdquo; next to
&ldquo;grodpole holder&rdquo;! I can assure you however that after one has experienced all emotional
states between fussing (over picture choice) and mad panic (when word crashes again!), this is not the
case. Combine this with a picture of me trying to explain to my Greek female ottice mate exactly why.
have a picture of a bum in a bra on my computer screen and you&rsquo;ll understand that this has been far tron
boring.</p><p>I&rsquo;m now only have my thankyous to left to say. Firstly thanks must go to the exec this year whos
hard work has been reflected through the success of the club, well done. Secondly thanks to Megan who:
bright smile followed by swift punch in the groin has &ldquo;encouraged&rdquo; many people to contribute! Alsc
thanks to Rich Marr who sorted out all the pictures, aren&rsquo;t they cool! A short note of thanks to my
supervisor for not pointing out the obvious fact that I haven&rsquo;t done any work fOr the last two weeks anc
finally thanks to the contributors. without whom I would have been shafted good and proper</p><h3 id=dinner-meet-dave-makes-a-speech>Dinner meet: Dave makes a speech</h3><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never get me p*ssed&rdquo; says Dave, as we set off in the bus to the Lake District&mldr; 24 hrs
later, after a bottle of whiskey the fact that he can still stand amazes most people, although getting dressed
proved a little tricky with others having to help out. Mucn amusement coming mom Dave assuring Us n6
can put on his tie himself, yeah right.
Anyway, we arrive for the dinner and ask the waitress for a bucket just in case. Phil Wicken:
makes THE quote, offending the waitresses to the degree that they refuse to serve his table /Typical caver.
Ed./. Dave gets up and makes his speech , which was remarkable coherent considering the whiskey,
Although nobody can remember what he said, was
it the bottle of Tequila? I&rsquo;m just guessing here. We
did however get him to read out the following.
Like wot?
Where do I put mi hands now?
No No No No No!
Sivams
I didn&rsquo;t fit in the crack.
You I never
get me p#ssed
The dinner finished swiftly with the
elections followed by the first of many chats on
the big white telephone. Dave (*5), Rich Marr and
Martin amongst the fallen on the battle scene with
the another 10 or so casualties the following morning. The few trying to get away with a sneaky vomi
didn&rsquo;t manage it. vou will be remembered. Those who managed courageously to keen their stomach
lininas. throuchout the previous night fell at the last post, breakfast. The biggest greasy spoon you have ever seen was served up by the owners of the hut. Consequently many posts were abandoned in the rush to
save respectability, and thanks to the unknown person adding diced carrots to the, much used, dunking
trough. The best excuse going AWOL came from Graham who tried to get away with blaming it on thi
Tequila worm he&rsquo;d eaten, until he realised someone else had drunk it!

to you if you do that don&rsquo;t we? Yes, you&rsquo;re exiled to S&amp;G (and if that doesn&rsquo;t teach you a lesson, nothing

watching an evening of British cinema including The Italian Job&rsquo; and Monty
Python&rsquo;s .and now for something completely different. This unbounded of
Stupidity was to set the atmosphere for the entire holidav.
A Taxi ride at breakneck
speed in the wee small hours took us to Gatwick airport. where the more enthusiastic
of us raced in luggage trolleys across the deserted terminal.
A plane and a train later we found ourselves in El Chorro (the centre of
nownere) onlv to tind an automobile driver
I by
our gracious host, and rally-driver wannabie
Jean, ready to take us further away tron
anvwhere. The climbing started immediately (although some more
relaxed members of the club decided that they wanted to acclimatise
to the nice weather betore doing anything too strenuous, 1e
sunbathing). El Chorro is a small town on the train line between
Malaga and Seville and is a popular venue for climbers from all
around Europe. The gorge (through which the train line winds its
way) provides varied routes of all grades for beginners and hard-core
climbers alike. with routes anvwhere from 20ft to 400ft in length. In
addition to climbing, the surrounding hills are excellent for mountain
biking.
A 70 vear old steel cable, stretchina diagonallv across the
gorge provided entertainment and photo opportunities as thre
members of the club travelled across (at this point please bear in
mind that the cable is over 100m above a white-water river and is 150m long). Surprisingly enough there were no serious casualties during the trip, (and all of the minor
injuries seemed to be focused on James a rock fell on me&rsquo; Philips). Our honoured treasurer did some
rather impressive shit, and we all cheered. He also fell off, and we cheered again and threw beans at him
Arguably the most epic climb of the trip was a route named El Amptrax, graded French 6a (where 8c is
about the hardest climbable). Amptrax was a route that went up the highest part of the rock and took the
entire day for two pairs of climbers to complete, and included a dramatic overhang on the final pitch
Not all Of our time was spent being macho, tanned, hard-bodj
types. We also spent some time walking in the hills absorbing the beautifu
scenery (yean right), as well as swimming naked in the reservoir just north
of the upper gorge (no seriously we did, apart form the naked bit, I lied
about that) / and the bar, Ed. J. At this point I would like to say that Belay
bunny only had chips (SOrry a personal joke, It&rsquo;s very tunny, trust me). Al
the end or the week we were loath to leave, but with shortening tunas and
looming exams we returned home, with improved personal bests and some nice tans.</p><h3 id=les-alpes-sams-epic>Les alpes: Sam&rsquo;s epic</h3><p>Quite a few people managed to get out to the Alps this summer (Graham, Ian, James,

Finally! The weather forecast from the &ldquo;Office de Haute Montagne&rdquo; in Chamonix, predicted a
Clear sunny day. Vur chance had come to do a route on the Aiguille de I&rsquo;M. My climbing partner, Ben and I set off early from the campsite to catch the cable car from the town at 7am to reach the Plan du
&lsquo;Aiguille. We had decided to do a relatively low route (a maximum altitude of 2844m) to avoid the snow
that had built up, but there was still up to a foot of snow on the lower slopes.
We trekked for two hours across small snowfields and glacial moraine. The route we had planned
to do had a bit of snow and ice on it and looked very bad. We had crampons and ice axes with us, but w
decided to do an easier route which Should be in better condition with more sun facing it. After another
trek we finally began climbing the NNE ridge of the M. The route was better, but still had snow coverer
ledges, and climbing in rock shoes made getting over these difficult. A couple of other climbers started to
follow us up, and they turned out to be British.
The first pitches of the climb were alright, but they began to get harder. We soon reached a large
ledge which had lots of snow on it, and I got my feet cold and wet. The next pitch was a small chimner
but it had ice on the inside, which made it difficult to gel
up. Ben lead the ditch and I managed to scramble un it

We were soon joined by the other climbers, Roger and Michelle (trom Barnsley), who were alsc
very tired and unsure of the &lsquo;walk out&rsquo; route. Ben and I decided to abseil off the way we had climbed up, as
at least we knew the way. The chance of us catching the cable car was now very slim. We had onlv:
single 50m rope with us so it would take several abseils to get down. We had to leave bits of sling and
cord behind tied around spikes to thread the rope through. We saw the others following us down, but they
were using two 50m ropes tied together.
We reached the large ledge about a third of the way down, when we heard shouts from above. We
stopped and looked up to see Michelle shouting down to us that they had got their ropes jammed,

Michelle was waiting. They managed to absell and scramble down to where we were waiting. They only
had two pieces of rope left, about one third of their original length.
It was starting to get dark now, and was still snowing. The four of us abseiled down our rope off
the rest of the mountain. By the time we reached the base, it was black and we had missed the cable car
down by hours. There was nothing for it but to walk down to the valley, 1500m below us.
We only had a few torches with us, and the ground was very difficult with snow to start with

exhausted and stumbling along these rough tracks, often tripping up over rocks and roots. Our torch

and go to sleep under it. We could see the town lights, but they never seemed to get closer. At 2am We

being a keen student, I naturally took the opportunity of spending a year in France at a college in Lyon as
to broaden my horizons and learn the French way of engineering. It had nothing to do witl
the close proximity of the Alps and endless possibilities of routes on rock, snow and ice to explore.
The mountaineering club in Lyon are a good crowd who I met at the year&rsquo;s hirst p<em>ss up, and who
then decided it would be a laugh to invite some English p</em>sshead, to do some climbing with them. The
year started well with a few easy warm up peaks ( Pic de l&rsquo;tendard, and the Alberon) which gave me
chance to overcome some quite important communication difficulties. These routes were simple glacie:
walks although a little steep in places for the Alberon. After that, before it got too cold we did one
weekend of big rock routes in the Erins massif. this was one of the best weekends I&rsquo;ve had this year and
we did one route high up graded D, and one route the next day of 350m at a level around 6a, quoter

Unfortunately after that there were lots of parties so I stayed in Lyon. (Two coachloads of

Delore Christmas however, I did manage to spend 5 davs near Chamonix (Cluses&rsquo;
doing some big rock routes (not too high up because it was cold) and a weekend in the Calanques (set
cliffs near Marseilles: reminded me of Devon)
After Christmas the ice chimbing season begins. We are but mortal men, so interspersed with
some climbing a group of us had a go at that to. By halt term we were getting quite reasonable and hadn'1
yet had any fatal injuries, but then one dark night while descending I tripped over and cut my finger. Fully
recovered by half term I did a bit more including Chere Couloir on Mont Blanc du Tacul. /A route I car
personally recommend, Ed./ Finally on the last day I did my first bit of vertical ice which was a cigar of
about 10 meters followed by other smaller vertical passages. [NICE, Ed.] After that all the ice falls fell
down, sometimes with people on them, so we stopped climbing them.
Since half term I&rsquo;ve done a few other things, some skung and ski trekking but what I really want
to do is an approach on skis, then an iced up gully then decent on skis, but the weather hasn&rsquo;t beer
so that will have to walt.
That&rsquo;s about all. I hope you&rsquo;ve had a cool year, and if any one wants to come out to the Alps al
Easter or in the summer, I shall be there all the time. Hope you have a good dinner meet, (worms aren&rsquo;t
good for you).
Also if it&rsquo;s not too late I&rsquo;d like to give the presidents spot a go, so don&rsquo;t forget to vote for me.

I&rsquo;m concerned it&rsquo;s a bloody good one! The trip started with having our normal early hours arrival at thr
Count House which was complete with regimented lines of drawing pins, and more rules than a nunnery.
We emerged from our sleeping bags, later that morning (about 4 hours later to be precise) only tc
realise that we had picked the one weekend in the entire Cornish winter that had seen any sun! The
weather outside even managed to motivate Garth to emerge from his bag with less than the customar:

hut appreciated).
The next day was spent in pretty much the same fashion as the first, with me getting my
confidence back and everyone else basking in the second day of lovely sun. We prepared to leave with a
great deal of reluctance, Megan providing entertainment for Sam and Garth - Sam attempting to drown
her in the shower and Gareth performing the first steps of some bizarre mating ritual by wiping a dirty T

Chosen because the guide book describes it as a route that changes little with conditions. A
phrase I now consider to be the biggest lie I&rsquo;ve ever heard, including the excuses for not writing articles!
The first pitch (out of condition) consisted of using 3 lumps of turf to climb 20m of iceless slab.

Camping&rdquo; sign in the Chair ladder car park we couldn&rsquo;t be arsed to find anywhere else! After discovering
that most of the tents had certain essential bits missing, we managed to erect some vaguely tent like tents
and collapse into them only to be evicted in the morning by a pointy head with a dog which wanted to get
into James bivvy bag with him! However it did get going nice and early, we were climbing at Sennen by
about 9.30!
Sennen was pretty nifty, the routes are quite hard and exposed for their grade. I did two HSs, on
the first I had to place a bit of pro whilst using an undercut to reach over an overhang (then proceed lc
pull over the overhang!!). On the second I had to swing out onto a large flake, hand traverse along it with
smears for feet and then mantle shelf onto it - with no hand holds to pull on. Phoar, can 1 have your
children? Ed. / It was excellent! I think I might go back in the summer cause it would be gorgeous
without a force 10 gale!! We managed to find a valid campsite after climbing, despite James&rsquo; cained
protestations that we should go to St Ives &ldquo;cause it was NICE&rdquo;!! The site owner however was a old pointy
headed female with the site itself not being much better. Since all the proper sites were shut however it
was a pretty good, cheap place to camp, with a dub up the road.
Sunday we went to Bosigran and while Daffy launched up Door post I sat about getting rained or
by intermittent showers contemplating whether I could be arsed to climb a very slimy Ding. I decided I
couldn&rsquo;t and went for a hard core bimble (hard core since I was carving a 30-40 pound sack!!)/No excuse

nice secluded beach in the blazing sun I couldn&rsquo;t resist a quick dip. This, of course, caused the entire bas
to suddenly be filled with parents and small children leaving me to run back to my bag (half way up the
beach) in my wet boxers in front of a crowd Wembley would be proud of!! The others, by all accounts

Upon arriving in Lanator
Matravers, we headed for a rendezvous with Sam in The King&rsquo;s Arms. This turned out to be a counle o
barrels of ale in someone&rsquo;s living room, and we almost apologised for bursting into the landlord&rsquo;s home
before we realised it was the local pub. Our local guide arrived before closing time with the news that Old
Tom&rsquo;s Field was closed, so we set up for the night in Young Sam&rsquo;s Lounge. This is a highly recommender
camp site, but watch out for Sam&rsquo;s chocolate logs. Many thanks to the wardens for the use of their well
mamtamned faculties.
The following morning we took the ferry across to Swanage, a surreal experience in the dense
morning fog and eerily silent and calm waters. After breakfast at Ricky&rsquo;s we checked out the local
shop and agreed to meet back at the bus. As per tradition, we lost Al K and almost left him behind. We
chose to go for the climbs at Winspit because they offered a good range of climbs in some fabulou:
surroundings. Al P and I decided to try a well polished HVS 5b ammonite but by the end of the day it had
managed to defeat all of us. Meanwhile Daffy tackled an excellent VS and Ruth, Sam and Al P had a go at
some bolted E&rsquo;s (blot wendies, Ed.] which were far too exciting. Cursing the bad design of ancient sea
creatures, Al P and I went to try the trad routes by the sea but found them to be a bit wet (and there was :
lot of water too). We returned to the Juarrvman&rsquo;s Wall to nav on the bolted routes instead. At the end of
the day Daffy lobbed fantastically on an HVS he was trying to lead, and Ruth and Al P found a trad route
in the quarry that wasn&rsquo;t apparently in the guide book, and promptly named it Lard Arse.
As the night drew in we decided to head back into Swanage to find a pub. We encountered some
particularly odd locais in The Anchor (even odder than us), and decided to hide from them in the back oi
the pub. However they
probably thought Ruth was pretty odd [and who wouldn&rsquo;t, Ed.] when they heard
her announce that she &ldquo;alwavs noticed when it was in front of her. but didn&rsquo;t notice it from behind&rdquo; and
that &ldquo;doing it forwards is much worse that doing it backwards&rdquo; - abselling of course. We decided to cros:
quickly over to The Swan where we dined and danced the night away to the live music from the rocking
and totally un-valentines band. Finally we staggered back up the hill to camp out under the glittering stars
and sweeping bear of the lighthouse&mldr; or on a log if Daffy had anything to do with putting up the tent!
The next morning we arrived at the country park before the crack of dawn (So that&rsquo;ll be Llish
then? Ed.J. As the sun rose we knew we were in for a fabulous day at the Subluminal cliffs. Al K
promptly established our presence at the cliffs by setting up the &ldquo;Abseil Rope Of Doom&rdquo; just east of the
popular Balcony route. A number of friendly climbers who politely asked to make use of the rope were
seen to struggle back up over the edge of the cliff a few hours later, in an obviously less friendly mood.
The bottom of the abseil involved a lovely near-inverted, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t wanna break my skull&rsquo;, free-fall finish fo
added amusement factor - thanks Al. This provided excellent practice for those in the group (previously)
not keen on the activity, and prepped us for some excellent climbs on possibly the best coastal crags in the
country. The easier severe route Gangway provided valuable trad gear leading experience for both Daffy
and myself. Later in the day we were joined by other members of ICMC. James took Megan on the climbs
near face, and lan et al. disappeared to look for some nice hard routes /located in the pub perchance:
Ed.J. Ruth, Daffy and Al P tried a mixed up combination of Highstreet and Bypass, and later Megan made
a leisurely lead up the Highstreet (trust a woman to spend ages on the highstreet). When Al K and I got
rudely blocked off an HS route by some other climbers we decided to take a break, but Daffy and Al F
carried on by tackling first Corner. As the day came to its inevitable but unnecessary end, Ruth finishec
off by leading Damo up Curving Crack and after Al K finished his billionth cigry and went to rescue the
infamous ab rope. Of course, he managed to make another spectacular cock-up of the entire operation anc
almost ended up taking a swim (sorry Al but it&rsquo;s true)! He forgot his prusick (essential for ascending), anc
we suspect he used fart power from the previous night&rsquo;s Skull-ache bitter to get back un. Overall an
entertaining day to round off a perfect trip.
Many thanks to Al P for his excellent driving through the fog-scaped nights and WOCdt Woody for organising the trip (And the Banana Joke).
