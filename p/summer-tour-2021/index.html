1870s, but since the 1930s it has solidly established itself as one of the premier
bouldering destinations in the world. Everywhere you look there is something to
climb, with soft sandy landings and old shoeless Frenchmen offering advice on
technique. The boulders in Font are made of soft sandstone, which often forms very
rounded, chest shaving tops to boulders that can make even the most elegant of
climbers look like a beached whale. It is also world famous for its ridiculously
technical and sandbagged slabs that are incredibly useful for popping an overinflated
ego. It is also home to classic boulders of every grade, from <em>La Marie Rose</em> (f6a+), to
<em>Carnage</em> (f7b+) and <em>Rainbow Rocket</em> (f8a). Moreover, every sector in Font will have
a couple of circuits. These comprise of about 50 easier problems and the aim is to
complete all of them.</p><p>Fontainebleau was made famous to us by the movie <em>The Real Thing</em> , a 1996 classic
full of techno and hard climbing featuring Jerry Moffatt and Ben Moon. In this they
train on the gritstone boulders of Derbyshire and then come over to teach the French
how to climb on their own rock. Spurred on by our club trips to the Peak, we were
determined to make the journey to Font to do the same!</p><h3 id=objectives>Objectives</h3><p>After more than a year of COVID and lockdowns, our main objective was to be able
to travel abroad safely and responsibly. We all made sure to read up on the current
guidelines about international travel before setting off and adhered to all necessary
testing. It was unfortunate that the associated costs with extra testing in France and
on return to the UK made the trip prohibitively expensive for many potential
attendees. This limited our numbers to a small group of 8, but this served to
strengthen the relationships made within the group.</p><p>We also aimed to enjoy ourselves whilst staying safe as well as to sample some of
the French culture and language. This was done with great aplomb at the Lidl bakery
section. We all had our own climbing objectives for the trip, which are detailed below.</p><h3 id=the-team>The Team</h3><div class=data-table role=region tabindex=0><table class="table %!s(<nil>)" id=467982153><thead><tr><th style=text-align:center>Name</th><th style=text-align:center>Role</th><th style=text-align:center>Degree</th><th style=text-align:center>Year</th><th style=text-align:center>Aim</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center>Olly Tippett</td><td style=text-align:center>Tour Leader</td><td style=text-align:center>Mech Eng</td><td style=text-align:center>4th</td><td style=text-align:center>Do Rainbow Rocket, some circuits and slabs</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:center>Jake Lewis</td><td style=text-align:center>Tour Organiser</td><td style=text-align:center>Aero</td><td style=text-align:center>4th</td><td style=text-align:center>Climb a f7a, 100 boulder problems</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:center>Miguel &ldquo;One Move f7a&rdquo; Boland</td><td style=text-align:center>One Move f7a Eliminate Fetishist</td><td style=text-align:center>One Move f7a training</td><td style=text-align:center>f7a</td><td style=text-align:center>Climb a one move f7a eliminate</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:center>Emyr Williams</td><td style=text-align:center>The Slab Hero</td><td style=text-align:center>Aero</td><td style=text-align:center>4th</td><td style=text-align:center>Get back into climbing post COVID and do a full circuit.</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:center>James Gibson</td><td style=text-align:center>The Wad</td><td style=text-align:center>Maths</td><td style=text-align:center>3rd</td><td style=text-align:center>Flash everyone else&rsquo;s projects</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:center>Chorley King</td><td style=text-align:center>Monsieur Dyno</td><td style=text-align:center>Aero</td><td style=text-align:center>3rd</td><td style=text-align:center>Climb a f7a</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:center>Ben Jones</td><td style=text-align:center>The Medic</td><td style=text-align:center>Medicine</td><td style=text-align:center>4th</td><td style=text-align:center>Climb a f7 in Font</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:center>George Gun</td><td style=text-align:center>Le Garçon Large</td><td style=text-align:center>Des Eng</td><td style=text-align:center>3rd</td><td style=text-align:center>Climb a f7a</td></tr></tbody></table></div><h2 id=overview-of-the-tour>Overview of the tour</h2><h3 id=itinerary>Itinerary</h3><h4 id=day-1-19921>Day 1 (19/9/21)</h4><p>The first day was spent travelling to Fontainebleau. Olly
drove his van with a few pads to the campsite and set up
in the early afternoon. He was then joined by Miguel,
Jake, James, and Emyr who had driven a separate car
from England. They all set up the brand-new tent and
were excited by its lack of mould and holes. A tarp was
set up from the van to some trees to construct a sitting
area for when it rained. They had just missed the season
for the campsite swimming pool being open, so had to
settle for the occasional shower with poor water pressure. Eager to get climbing, the
early to arrive people ventured out to <em>Gorge aux Chats,</em> the local crag to the
campsite. There they acquainted themselves with the local rock and attempted the
softest problem in Font, <em>Dallain</em> (f6c). It was a one move dyno that most people did to
make them feel better about themselves after getting completely shut down by a
desperate f3+ slab.</p><figure><img src=YAYAYA/p/summer-tour-2021/images/van.png width=300></figure><figure><img src=YAYAYA/p/summer-tour-2021/images/ben.jpg width=300></figure><p>After a brief tickle of the rocks, Olly had to leave
to pick up Ben and George from the train station.
By the time this was done it was getting dark, so
everyone met back at the campsite. The team
cooked chilli sin carne and ate it very quickly. The
evening concluded with everyone sipping on
cheap tiny French beers, when suddenly the
question arose, where was Chorley?</p><figure><img src=YAYAYA/p/summer-tour-2021/images/jake_ben.jpg width=300></figure><h4 id=day-2-20921>Day 2 (20/9/21)</h4><p>That night, everyone could hear the sound of
rain on the tent, signalling a mandatory rest
day. Sandstone is very fragile when wet, so it
is very bad form to try to climb it after rain. This
meant that they decided to walk the 25 mounds
circuit of the forest. It was about 13 miles and
took in 25 hills with over 1000m of vertical
ascent, going through some of the classic
climbing locations. Miguel and Emyr decided to
run this circuit and did so impressively in under
3 hours. The rest got about halfway before
questioning their motivations but had to carry
on as it was the shortest way back. They all arrived back shortly before dark, all
grumpy that they had to go for a massive trek rather than climb.</p><figure><img src=YAYAYA/p/summer-tour-2021/images/jake.jpg width=300></figure><p>In the meantime, Miguel had picked Chorley up from the train station, and everyone
was now at the campsite. Chorley had to undergo a Flixbus nightmare. His bus was
late on the ferry, meaning that he missed his connection. After being ushered onto a
seemingly random coach, he had to check maps on his phone to make sure the bus
was in fact destined for Paris. He eventually made it after almost 24 hours of travel.
For dinner, Olly made his famous chorizo carbonara, which everyone managed to
force down, but spirits were high as the forecast looked good for the next few days.</p><figure><img src=YAYAYA/p/summer-tour-2021/images/chorley_2.png width=300></figure><h4 id=day-3-21921>Day 3 (21/9/21)</h4><p>The next morning the team headed to <em>Roche aux
Sabots</em> , a crag with relatively little forest cover so the
rocks got the sun and dried quicker. The aim was to
complete either the blue or orange circuit over the
course of the day, however for most this changed to
climbing whatever looked cool. Most people got to
about the 20th problem of the circuit before going to try
hard on something else. A group went to try <em>Graviton</em>
(f7a). The hard part of this was getting over the very
top, which prompted Chorley to
try to jump past the top, resulting in a rash over his chest.
Meanwhile Miguel was working on a boulder called <em>Legalize
This</em> (f7a). This was a one move f7a eliminate from undercuts
to the top of the block. Miguel was consistently getting his
hand over the top but couldn’t latch the hold. Chorley came
over and sent it, fulfilling his aim of climbing f7a on his first day
climbing. He then repeated the problem next go to get it on
video. Olly also did the problem, first go, in flip flops, proving
once again that he is the greatest climber in the club. Olly had
also achieved his goal of completing the blue circuit that day,
which provided a lot of varied and entertaining boulder
problems. The best of these were recommended to the rest of
the group. Over the day James had done a few f7a and f7a+s without anyone
noticing. At the end of the day, Miguel had to be pulled away from his one move
eliminate f7a project as it was getting dark.</p><figure><img src=YAYAYA/p/summer-tour-2021/images/oli_rainbow.png width=300></figure><figure><img src=YAYAYA/p/summer-tour-2021/images/chorley_3.jpg width=300></figure><figure><img src=YAYAYA/p/summer-tour-2021/images/george_2.jpg width=300></figure><figure><img src=YAYAYA/p/summer-tour-2021/images/17.png width=300></figure><p>Ben cooked coq au van for dinner, which was delicious and contained a good
amount of red wine although it could not compete with the Lidl “peach rings” that
everyone on the trip had become addicted to by now. Everyone felt thoroughly
knackered by the end of the meal and got to sleep very quickly.</p><h4 id=day-4-22921>Day 4 (22/9/21)</h4><p>The next day most of the team ventured to F <em>ranchard Isatis</em> , a classic of Font
bouldering areas. Chorley and Olly however went to <em>Franchard Sablons Carriers</em>
instead in the morning to try their projects. Chorley was trying <em>Sylphide</em> (f7a) whilst
Olly attempted <em>Rainbow Rocket</em> (f8a). Both took turns at trying their boulders while
the other rested in the hammock. They each touched the top of their dynos, but neither could stick it. After a couple hours of trying, they both gave up and headed to
<em>Isatis</em> to meet up with the others. When they got there,
they found that the rest had befriended an old pof-riddled
Frenchman. He was chastising them about using shoes
and crash pads as well as spotting with one hand with a
cigarette in to other. He did show us some good problems
though, as well as Miguel another eliminate f7a dyno for
him to wear his skin more on. Everyone was fairly tired
after the previous day of climbing so were taking it easy,
although a few people went to try some highball problems,
which put hairs on their chests. After a final bit of climbing, they all retreated to the
campsite for some well-earned risotto and rest.</p><p><figure><img src=YAYAYA/p/summer-tour-2021/images/18.jpg width=300></figure><figure><img src=YAYAYA/p/summer-tour-2021/images/19.png width=300></figure><figure><img src=YAYAYA/p/summer-tour-2021/images/20.jpg width=300></figure></p><h4 id=day-5-23921>Day 5 (23/9/21)</h4><p>After a brief stop to buy every baguette and
pastry at Lidl, the team ventured to <em>La Canche
aux Merciers</em> for some more bouldering. This was
a particularly nice crag despite the hordes of
French urchins school children running around
being annoying and the disabled dog that could
boulder harder than any of us to get to our food
bag and eat our cured meats and cheese.
Today’s aim was the same as the others; start
trying to do a circuit, then get distracted and try
something too hard. Olly, Emyr and Jake did
manage to complete their full circuits, whilst
James smashed out some more f7a and f7a+s. A
multitude of other problems were attempted; a
few people tried a f7a+ roof, a few tried some
weird crack, and Miguel found another one move
f7a eliminate. Ben nearly finished the whole
circuit, but got completely shut down by a f3+
slab, which caused most people a lot of
frustration. They left the crag late that evening
with very sore skin and very hungry.
Unfortunately, they had to wait until 11pm for
Jake’s underwhelming spaghetti bolognaise to be
ready, by which time everyone was full from
snacking on too many peach rings and
bolognaise flavoured crisps. They didn’t let Jake
be in charge of cooking again.</p><figure><img src=YAYAYA/p/summer-tour-2021/images/21.png width=300></figure><h4 id=day-6-24921>Day 6 (24/9/21)</h4><p>On their penultimate climbing day, the team awoke to a dense
fog. They drove to <em>Bas Cuvier</em> to see if the rock was dry and
were greeted by a slightly moist crag. The team did some
stretching on the pads while they waited for the rock to dry
and realised that they were all very stiff from all the climbing.
They then warmed up by throwing a
crash pad at each other. By the time
they were bored of this the fog had
cleared, the sun was out, and the rock
was dry. <em>Bas Cuvier</em> was supposed to
be the most classic crag in Font, however it was strewn with
broken glass, used hypodermic needles, condoms and
human excrement. This rather diminished the psych to
climb, and the rock was quite polished, however the team
tried <em>La Marie Rose</em> (f6a+), which is potentially the most famous boulder in Font.
James tried to do <em>Carnage</em> (f7b+) and got close
before giving up. Olly tried to do <em>L&rsquo;Hélicoptère</em>
(f7a), named for what your legs do when you fall
off. He didn’t do it but he also didn’t break
anything, so that was a win. Miguel couldn’t find a
one move eliminate f7a so was grumpy. George
tried <em>Pif-paf</em> (f7a), a route named after a powerful
nerve agent cockroach killing spray. He swiftly
gave up due to the problem’s proximity to the
human turd. Well before it was dark, everone
realised that they were absolutely wrecked, so they went back to the campsite via a
pizza place for dinner.</p><figure><img src=YAYAYA/p/summer-tour-2021/images/george_3.jpg width=300></figure><figure><img src=YAYAYA/p/summer-tour-2021/images/george_4.jpg width=300></figure><h4 id=day-7-25921>Day 7 (25/9/21)</h4><p>The day began with a trip to the local town to be
tested for COVID before travelling back to the UK.
After and French lady had aggressively swabbed our
noses, we headed to <em>Le Cul de Chien.</em> This was half
crag half beach and was probably the best one that
the team went to. After a long week with only one rest
day at the very start, the team weren’t psyched on
trying anything too hard, so aimed for another circuit.
This didn’t end up happening for most however, since
as normal they were distracted by a different boulder.
The team tried some f6a+ mantle, which was another
chest scraper. Most people managed this, despite
some astounding inflexibility from Jake. A few people also managed to finish their
circuits after this, and the team made sure to dog proof their food bag. George tried
<em>Le Toit du Cul du Chien</em> (f7a), which looked a bit like (and is named after) the behind of a dog. He got some good pictures
of him falling off it.</p><p>Miguel, again
unhappy with the lack of one move
f7a eliminates, went back to the
nearby <em>Roche aux Sabots</em> to try his
one move f7a eliminate project. He
spent a short while trying before
realising that this one move f7a
eliminate wasn’t for him. He decided
in future to change his style and aim
to climb a one move f7a eliminate in
the UK on different rock. A few people
had meanwhile managed a full circuit,
while others lay on the sand trying to
grow back their skin that had been eroded over the week. They drove back to the
campsite for a final night of curry and tiny French beer, sad at the thought of leaving
the next day.</p><figure><img src=YAYAYA/p/summer-tour-2021/images/george_5.jpg width=300></figure><h4 id=day-8-26921>Day 8 (26/9/21)</h4><p>The next morning they woke up and packed the tent
up. After checking out the campsite, Miguel drove his
car back to the UK. Olly and George had booked a
later ferry before going back in the van, so went to
have a final look at <em>Rainbow Rocket</em> , but it was wet
after an overnight shower, so they drove back and
ate chips in Calais waiting for their ferry. The team
made the most of their duty free allowance, George
hasn’t been able to walk in a straight line since he got
back.</p><h3 id=tour-review>Tour Review</h3><p>We all achieved negative COVID results both in
France and on return of the UK, which meant that we
had fulfilled our goal of not spreading the virus. We
had also had a week of climbing with no injuries or
major dramas.</p><p>In terms of personal climbing objectives, only Chorley
managed to reach his goal of climbing f7a, whilst
Olly, Jake and Emyr managed to complete at least
one full circuit. Jake did manage to climb well over 100 problems and Emyr got back
into climbing with style. James ticked a number of hard problems over f7a but failed
to do the hardest problem of the trip, so decided to lock himself in a gym and train for
6 years.</p><p>Miguel’s search for a one move f7a eliminate continues. The whole trip ran smoothly, without any real issues. The low number of people
meant that logistics were easier and that we could drive around crags. The main
negative of the trip was the lack of rest days. The team had 5 climbing days in a row,
which really took a toll on their skin and their psych. Next time it would be better to
go for a week extra and have more rest days. All in all Font delivered all that we
hoped it would, and the club will definitely be back in future years.</p><h2 id=budget>Budget</h2><p>While the initial budget was made for 15 people to take three
cars from the UK, the costs associated with being tested
both in France (€20 each) and in the UK (~£50 each) made
the trip more expensive per person than anticipated. This
was offset by the fact that only 8 people came as opposed to
the 15 budgeted for. Overall, the expenditure on travel was
£1665,13, which included getting a car and a van, as well as
the other members who couldn’t fit in these, to and from
Fontainebleau. The IC Trust gave us £670.50 of funding,
which was slightly less than the 40% of travel expenditure
we ended up having (£695.95). Overall, the trip could have
been much cheaper had we not had to spend so much on
testing and had we all gone to and from London together,
however space in the car was a major constraint. Added to this, George came from
Croatia and Ben from Rome, and Ben left a day early, adding to the expenses.</p><div class=data-table role=region tabindex=0><table class="table %!s(<nil>)" id=934856721><thead><tr><th style=text-align:center>Expenditure</th><th>Value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=text-align:center>Campsite</td><td>£488</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:center>Food</td><td>£253.33</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:center>Ferries</td><td>£380.73</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:center>Tolls</td><td>£91.27</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:center>Fuel</td><td>£449.15</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:center>COVID testing</td><td>£520</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:center>Busses</td><td>£113.99</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:center>Trains</td><td>£183.99</td></tr><tr><td style=text-align:center>Total</td><td>£2480.46</td></tr></tbody></table></div><h2 id=conclusion-and-future-plans>Conclusion and Future Plans</h2><p>The tour was a fun trip abroad for everyone, and we will definitely be back to Font in
future. All attendees not in their final year of study expressed interest in going on and
potentially running future tours, and the experience and competence of outdoor
boulderers in the club has been markedly improved. Miguel is still looking for a one
move f7a eliminate, if you know of one please contact him at:
