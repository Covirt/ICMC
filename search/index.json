[{"content":"Author: Wynsee Lau\n“One for the history books” can only begin to describe the experience that was Fresher’s Trip 2025. This is a long one, so I have graciously included an abstract for TLDR purposes.\nAbstract The 2025 Fresher’s Trip was an eventful blend of climbing, chaos, and mechanical misadventure. Over the course of the trip, twenty-five climbers navigated all the challenges that the weekend had to offer - from shattered minibus windows and rogue fireworks to the infamous Double Meat Junction, midnight creek swims and dangerously competitive boulder-pad wrestling matches. Freshers and veterans alike demonstrated remarkable resilience and creativity, executing improvised window repairs, heroic minibus hill starts and questionable feats of boulder-pad engineering. Despite the obstacles, the trip concluded successfully, with all participants returning to London slightly battered, but immensely entertained and with a renewed sense of ICMC camaraderie.\nThe Journey We set off on a chilly Friday night, twenty five keen climbers packed into one minibus and two cars, £60 worth of Library Café cakes in hand and a long drive ahead. After a few games of Fireboy and Watergirl (Fig.1), we formulated a game plan. Benedict’s car would pick up Zak and the last few bits of gear from Westway. Isaac’s car would stop off at Wynsee’s house to collect a couple sleeping mats. The minibus would head to the Earl’s Court Tesco Superstore to pick up Jeremy, Arush and the all-important food shop. With the vehicles loaded, 13 wide-eyed freshers aboard and spirits high, we set off for The Peak District - only 45 minutes later than anticipated (Fig.2)!\nFigure 1: Lola, Arav, Quynh and Shu (L-R) playing Fireboy and Watergirl at Beit Quadrangle.\nFigure 2: Olaf, Vasily and Ethan (L-R) excited to embark upon their first Fresher’s Trip.\nIt was a promising start. One that lasted approximately 15 minutes, at which point the two cars received word of the weekend’s first misfortune.\nThe Window The incident occurred deep within the treacherous lanes of the Earl’s Court Tesco Superstore car park at around 19:00. While attempting an ambitiously tight left-hand turn, the minibus made contact with one of the walls and the left passenger window shattered all over poor Seamus (Fig.3,4).\nFigure 3: Moments after disaster.\nFigure 4: The shattered window framing Seamus’ expression of horror.\nFortunately, no one was hurt as a result of the accident and the passengers swiftly evacuated the vehicle. Faced with the possibility of having to cancel the trip, the committee launched into a series of crisis calls to determine the most appropriate course of action. With the Union out of hours, Noah sought counsel from the security team who, after a thorough risk assessment, advised the careful removal of the remaining glass and the strategic application of cardboard and tape. The team got to work with a roll of duct tape, and a dream. They pushed out the glass with surgical precision and neatly taped two pieces of MDF (very kindly donated by Tesco) with binbags sandwiched in between them to the window frame (Fig.5,6).\nFigure 5: Jeremy demonstrating Imperial’s engineering prowess through the strategic deployment of MDF and duct tape.\nFigure 6: Noah (L) and Benjamin (R) implementing cutting-edge waterproofing technology, demonstrating the real-world potential of Imperial’s latest metamaterials research.\nThe freshers looked on in awe, bewildered by the expert craftsmanship unfolding before them, carried out by Imperial’s finest engineers (Fig.7).\nFigure 7: ICMC freshers Oscar, Jonathan, Olaf, Vasily, and Toby (L–R) observing and documenting a live demonstration of advanced structural engineering techniques and applied metamaterials research.\nIn no time at all (1 and a half hours), the window was as good as new and the all-important food shop was done (Fig.8,9).\nFigure 8: Seamus supervising the safe storage of the food shop, ensuring no further losses to morale.\nFigure 9: The final result of the engineering masterclass - peer-review pending.\nOne last obstacle stood between the team and their grand departure. The contact had critically compromised the door latch, now refusing every attempt from the team to close it. With a few delicate and highly technical manoeuvres (a few body slams), the door finally cooperated.\nThe Cars Isaac’s car collected the sleeping mats and Benedict’s car picked up some gear from Westway - where Isaac executed, quite possibly, the worst parallel park job in ICMC history. By 9pm, everyone was back on track and we set off once again - only 3 hours later than anticipated. Isaac’s car, feeling somewhat left out of the evening’s excitement, soon stumbled upon a scene of modern chivalry and found itself in the crossfire of a Lime bike fireworks jousting battle. Thanks to Isaac’s skilful handling of the car, no was harmed in spite of Gao’s unfortunately opened passenger window. Fortunately, the window repair services of the minibus team were not necessary on this occasion. They made it to the M1 with the help of Kian’s questionable navigation, but just as Wynsee was recounting Isaac’s impressive mid-firework manoeuvring of the car to Peter, Isaac suddenly slammed on the brakes as to not rear-end the car in front. The gap between the two cars shrank alarmingly but by some miracle, no contact was made and a motorway crash was luckily avoided. It was safe to say we then turned down the music a bit to calm the nerves of a slightly frazzled Isaac. The two cars met up at the Leicester Forest East Service Station to refuel and to allow Kian to stretch out his poor hip flexors. Benedict’s car did not seem to have any incidents to report. Arnav appreciated the peace so much, he had apparently set off into a slumber several times. After an interesting incident in which Isaac’s car seemingly teleported around the car park (a result of Benedict’s boredom due to his rather uneventful drive and Kian’s cruel betrayal), the two cars set off on the final stretch to Rowsley Village Hall.\nThe AdBlues :( The minibus team on the other hand, continued their impressive streak of misfortune. A warning had popped up on the dashboard: the AdBlue needed refilling, or the minibus would not restart after a certain number of miles. Noah promptly purchased and refilled the AdBlue, but the warning persisted. This would have to be an issue for another day, it was getting late and the priority was to get everyone to the village hall. Travelling through the pitch black, the team discovered that the minibus was severely underqualified to tackle the rolling hills of the Peak District – it was in fact, rolling down them, backwards. On several occasions, the team had to go out and push the minibus to help start it - at one point, leaving Arav sprinting after it, leaping aboard while it was still in motion all while nursing his toe fracture (affectionately named Bendi).\nThe minibus team finally arrived at Rowsley Village Hall at approximately 2:30am and were welcomed by a lovely platter of cakes and desserts from the Library Café. After trialling several sleeping arrangements (Fig.10,11) to compensate for the shortage of sleeping mats and Isaac insisting that he did not need a sleeping bag (he later regretted this), we all nodded off for an early night (3:30am).\nFigure 10: Ethan (L) and Jeremy (R) evaluating the chair-based sleeping arrangement. The approach was ultimately discarded, possibly because of its resemblance to Jeremy’s funeral earlier this year.\nFigure 11: Ethan trialling the boulder-pad bed. He maintained that this single-pad arrangement was superior to the traditional two-pad configuration.\nDay 1 The group woke up bright and early (8:30am) to the sweet melody of Free Tibet and the kitchen was swiftly filled with the comforting smells of instant coffee and toast (Fig.12). Many members of the trip tried Biscoff spread for the first time. Notably, Ethan ate about half a tub. Wynsee set up a very efficient eyeliner station (Fig.13) and Noah was churning out several mugs of microwaved porridge for the group to enjoy. Before long, we were fuelled up and ready to climb some rocks at The Roaches.\nFigure 12: The crew indulging in the vast variety of spreads and Noah diligently labouring over his mugs of oats.\nFigure 13: Wynsee applying eyeliner on Benjamin at the highly optimised eyeliner station.\nUnfortunately, the cars had to wait for about an hour at the crag as once again, the minibus demonstrated its incompetency on the hills. Isaac’s car bravely fended off a parking space for the minibus as they desperately tracked its location. They noticed the minibus had stopped in its tracks. Once again, the minibus team had had to push it up the hills (Fig.14) and Arav recreated his dramatic leap (much to the dismay of Bendi).\nFigure 14: Ethan, Arav, Arush, Olaf, Vasily and Benjamin pushing the minibus up the hills on the way to the crag. Arav running after the minibus.\nOn the verge of a breakdown due to the AdBlue issue, the minibus frantically drove past the space that Isaac’s car had defended and found a more accessible parking space – this would turn out to be an unfortunate mistake.\nThe Roaches Finally at the crag, we got some climbing in! A big group were climbing “Greener Traverse” (f5+) and “The Greener Traverse” (f6b) (Fig.15). Figure 15: The group trying “Greener Traverse” (f5+) and “The Greener Traverse” (f6b).\nArush, Mickey, Benedict and Louis tried “Stretch and Mantle” (f6C) and “Undercut Dyno” (f7B) (Fig.16).\nFigure 16: “Stretch and Mantle” (f6C).\nIsaac, Kian, Shu, Quynh, Mickey and Wynsee found a fun slab to try (Fig.17,18).\nFigure 17: Isaac standing on basically nothing.\nFigure 18: Mickey taking a selfie. Kian on the slab with Isaac, Shu and Quynh (L-R) looking on.\nJeremy and Benjamin set up a toprope on “Yong” (HVD 4a) - apparently not very well as later discovered by Isaac (Fig.19).\nFigure 19: Isaac at the top of “Yong” (HVD 4a), inspecting the anchor and discovering that both carabiners were unlocked and one of the gates were open. Jeremy and Benjamin also completed “Guano Gully” (S 4b) where some impressive spotting by Jeremy saved Benjamin from a nasty 3m ground fall (Fig.20).\nFigure 20: Benjamin at the top of “Guano Gully” (S 4b) relatively unscathed from his 3m fall thanks to Jeremy.\nIsaac set up his slackline (Fig.21) and Ethan completed his very first roped climb (Yong on toprope) with the help of Arush and Wynsee singing Gracie Abrams for encouragement (Fig.22). His send was closely followed by sends from Claire, Toby, Oscar and Arnav.\nFigure 21: Isaac guiding Arnav on the slackline.\nFigure 22: Ethan on his first ever roped climb (Yong on toprope)!\nEthan had a delicious triple decker bread sandwich (no water) for lunch while spooning Arav to tick off 2 squares from the Fresher’s Trip Bingo (Fig.23,24).\nFigure 23: Ethan enjoying his triple bread sandwich while spooning Arav.\nFigure 24: The Fresher’s Trip 2025 Bingo. Disappointingly, only 7 challenges were completed this trip.\nDown at the road, the glorified wheelie bin (the minibus) was throwing yet another tantrum. The AdBlue problem that was once deemed an issue for another day had now become a much more pressing issue with the minibus now refusing to start. Noah called a mechanic who confirmed that the minibus would have to get towed back to the village hall (Fig.25).\nFigure 25: The minibus about to get towed away.\nRegardless, spirits were still high. With the help of Louis, Benedict completed his first trad lead “Raven Rock Gully” (D) which he affectionately nicknamed “stinky crack” (Fig.26).\nFigure 26: Benedict after his first trad lead, \u0026ldquo;Raven Rock Gully” (D) aka “stinky crack”.\nArush, Toby, Oscar, Olaf, Ethan and Vasily went to the upper tier to try some boulders (Fig.27).\nFigure 27: Some sunset bouldering at the Upper Tier.\nQuynh went on a wander around the crag and at sunset, Vasily, Ethan, Wynsee and Toby walked to a nearby highpoint that overlooked the beautiful scenery (Fig.28,29,30). Oscar, Jonathan, Shu and Claire were getting in their final climbs for the day (Fig .31).\nFigure 28: Wynsee, Ethan, Vasily and Toby (L-R) at the highpoint. The minibus and the tow-truck could be seen at the road from here.\nFigure 29: A few stunning views!\nFigure 30: Wynsee (L) and Shu (R) admiring the sunset.\nFigure 31: Oscar, Claire, Shu and Jonathan (L-R) watching someone (Ethan?) on a toprope.\nThe sun was rapidly setting and it was home time. With the minibus now broken down, the committee had to improvise another plan to get everyone and all the gear back to the village hall. Noah sent 5 freshers (+ Seamus) off with the mechanic - no committee member required (?!) (they all made it back though) while Isaac ferried another five in his car. The last few people made it down from the crag and Ethan deemed his successful jumpscare Benjamin, Gao and Wynsee worth the rashes he got from the bush he was hiding in.\nFresher’s Dinner and Initiations With the help of Benedict and a few Ubers, we made it back to the village hall and the freshers began preparing a hearty veggie chilli for dinner (Fig.32). We soon learnt that the minibus had received a delightful £70 parking ticket at The Roaches (Fig.33). Given the circumstances (breaking down), there was not much Noah could have done. The good news was that the freshers had finished cooking a very impressive meal that we enjoyed before the ICMC initiations began (Fig.34).\nFigure 32: Claire, Shu, Vasily, Jonathan, Louis and Oscar working on the chilli (preparing way too many carrots).\nFigure 33: The parking ticket.\nFigure 34: Everyone enjoying the fresher’s veggie chilli. Jeremy and Arush cooked up the all-important Freaky Bru (Fig.35) and we began to set up the stage for the Boulder Pad Wrestling tournament where some very impressive matches ensued (Fig.36).\nFigure 35: Arush and Jeremy brewing their potion.\nThe Matches (no particular order) Winner Loser Arush Jeremy Benedict Louis Ethan Arush Isaac Kian Seamus Jeremy Jeremy Olaf Ethan Louis Isaac Benedict Shu Noah Jonathan Oscar Lola Shu Seamus Noah Olaf Arush Vasily Seamus Ethan (DNF/KO) Wynsee (DNF/KO) FINAL: Isaac FINAL: Vasily Figure 36: Boulder-pad wrestling in action: Olaf V Jeremy. Seamus diligently spotting.\nNotable matches include Seamus and Jeremy’s in which VAR had to be consulted, Seamus managed to take Jeremy’s sock off less than half a second before Jeremy could return the favour (Fig.37).\nFigure 37: The audience immensely entertained by Seamus and Jeremy’s incredibly close match.\nEthan and Wynsee’s match lasted approximately 6 seconds and ended in a concussion after Ethan decided to run straight at me. Unsurprisingly, I flew across the hall and smashed my head into the ground (Fig.38). I would argue this was a DNF as Ethan did not remove my sock, the others maintain this was a KO. Either way, the lessons learned are: don’t body slam into someone half your weight and wear a helmet if you are going to boulder-pad wrestle Ethan.\nFigure 38: Benjamin on ice-pack duty as Wynsee and Benjamin spectate.\nVasily and Isaac made it to the finals after some upsets knocked out the favourites (Benedict, Seamus and Ethan) (Fig.39). Helmets were adopted for this match after Wynsee’s unfortunate accident. Vasily fought valiantly for the honour of the freshers, but a well-timed tactical manoeuvre from Isaac secured him an early advantage. After a fiercely intense battle, both of Vasily’s socks had been removed (Fig.40) and Isaac emerged victorious as the 2025 Boulder-Pad Wrestling Champion (Fig.41).\nFigure 39: Vasily and Isaac’s pre-match photos.\nFigure 40: Isaac and Vasily engaged in an intense battle for the coveted Boulder-Pad Wrestling Champion title.\nFigure 41: Arush crowning Isaac as the 2025 Boulder-Pad Wrestling Champion.\nEthan, Arav, Louis and Benedict played the sling game while a few others attempted climbing over and under the tables where we saw some impressive sends (Fig.42). The term “The Olaf Method” was coined to describe an awkward and slightly painful head-first beta. Louis completed a very impressive nonsight of 4 consecutive tables, thanks in part to Jeremy accidentally pouring cider into his eyes mid-climb (Fig.43).\nFigure 42: Ethan, Arav, Benedict, Louis playing the sling game. Oscar, Isaac, Arush and Jeremy attempting the over and under table challenge in the background.\nFigure 43: Louis completing his nonsight of 4 consecutive tables. Jeremy providing Louis with a mid-climb goon.\nThe night ended with a leisurely midnight stroll and stargazing around the village (Fig.44). Despite the committee’s strong words of caution, Louis went for a chilly dip in the nearby creek. Jeremy and Arush may or may not have given him one too many mid-climb sips of cider. Louis made it out of the creek, slightly more sober than before (maybe not) and everyone finally headed off to bed an entire hour earlier than the night previous.\nFigure 44: The stars from Rowsley Village. We managed to spot Orion’s Belt and the Big Dipper (unconfirmed).\nDay 2 Day 2 started very similarly to Day 1. Everyone was awoken by the blasting of Free Tibet, and we headed to the kitchen for coffee, toast and Kian’s porridge. Benjamin found the binbags that he had convinced Wynsee were in the minibus (they were in his bag) and the group got to cleaning up the hall. Louis, Wynsee and Seamus spent about 20 minutes scraping burnt rice and oats off the bottom of the pots (Fig.45) but before long, everything was packed up into the vehicles and we headed off to Froggatt for another day of climbing.\nFigure 45: Louis engaged in the delicate process of oat removal, employing state-of-the-art pot-scraping equipment (spoon).\nThe minibus had stopped once again as Noah was about to park on the road (Fig.46). Louis stationed himself on the side of the road to direct traffic and the minibus team got out one last time to push. As we began unloading the gear, it started raining and it was getting heavier by the minute. Any hope of climbing was quickly dwindling and yet again, the committee had to improvise another plan. There were talks of going to the pub being thrown around but eventually, we settled on heading to The Foundry Climbing Gym in Sheffield (not beating the plastic princess allegations).\nFigure 46: The extensive queue of vehicles that formed behind the minibus.\nKian’s questionable navigation resulted in Isaac’s car doing several circles around The Foundry Gym before finally finding the entrance and discovering that Kian’s questionable navigation had led their car to The Foundry (weightlifting) Gym and not the climbing gym (Fig.47). After a lunch stop, we all made it to the (climbing) gym (Fig.48). The most notable send from this excursion was Zak’s indoor E3 on toprope! Benjamin discovered that you could not place gear into the cracks and thus lost his pizza bet with Jeremy.\nFigure 47: The Foundry (weightlifting) Gym.\nFigure 48: Noah swinging around at The Foundry (climbing) Gym.\nThe Double Meat Junction The final stop on this trip would be to Loughborough for the annual ICMC Fresher’s Trip Double Meat Junction tradition. 4 brave ICMC freshers (Oscar, Arnav, Kian and Ethan) took it upon themselves to attempt the formidable challenge of eating two large Meat Junction Pizzas within an hour to write themselves into ICMC history. Isaac, the sole 2024 champion, and indeed the only current champion in ICMC, strategically tapped out on the grounds that he still had about four hours of driving left to do. Oscar was off to a strong start, finishing one and a half pizzas in just 18 minutes. Ethan was off to an even stronger start, completing the same feat in only 10 minutes - though the rest of his car remained unconvinced by his strategy of leaving the crusts until the end. Arnav polished off his first pizza in 15 minutes and Kian maintained a steady, methodical pace. Conversely, Oscar and Ethan began to slow dramatically, each with half a pizza remaining (Fig.49).\nFigure 49: Kian (L) and Ethan (R) during their attempts of The Double Meat Junction. Kian can be seen multitasking as Isaac’s navigator. Amongst the drama of The Double Meat Junction, the expertly crafted MDF window was beginning to lose its structural integrity. With no more duct tape to secure the MDF, the minibus was at risk of losing its window to the depths of the M1. Leaning a few boulder pads against the window and the hopes and prayers of the 15 passengers would have to suffice to make it back to London (Fig.50).\nFigure 50: The minibus team reinforcing the structural integrity of the window using bouldering pads. Back to The Double Meat Junction, Arnav was the first to tap out with five slices still on his plate. Oscar followed shortly after, bowing out with two slices and a handful of neglected crusts (Fig. 51). A valiant effort from both, but with their failure, all remaining hope of victory passed to Isaac’s car.\nFigure 51: Oscar’s remaining slices of pizza and Oscar on his deathbed (he didn’t throw up though!).\nKian had only a couple of slices remaining, while Ethan faced his biggest challenge: the crusts. Time was running out, and both were visibly struggling. Then, as The Final Countdown played triumphantly in the background, Kian completed The Double Meat Junction in an astonishing 47 minutes (Fig.52). A full five minutes faster than Isaac’s 2024 victory, all while navigating! When asked for a victory speech, he could only manage a burp. As if The Double Meat Junction was not difficult enough, Kian then had a few Squares for dessert. A truly impressive showing.\nFigure 52: Kian on his final pizza slice.\nEthan, on the other hand, was well and truly against the clock. With only a few minutes remaining, he faced his final obstacle: a handful of the dreaded crusts - the self-proclaimed worst part of any pizza. In the dying seconds of the final minute and The Final Countdown playing in the background once again, Ethan completed The Double Meat Junction in 59 minutes. Upon his nail-biting victory, he offered a few truly motivational words: “Six, seven” (Fig.53).\nFigure 53: Ethan (self-proclaimed pizza hater) gracing the fans with his words of wisdom.\nAnd so, with sore muscles, full stomachs and one fewer minibus window to our name, we returned to London - a little sleepier, a little more brainrotted and a lot more seasoned in the art of surviving an eventful weekend (Fig.54).\nFigure 54: The minibus and all its passengers (only 9 photographed here\u0026hellip;?) safely returned to Beit.\nFinally, a few words of thank you are in order. Firstly, a huge thank you to everyone one who came on this trip, you all made this a genuinely unforgettable weekend. Your enthusiasm, despite the mishaps and the rain and cold, was truly inspiring. To everyone new to ICMC this year, I hope this trip gave you a taste of what we’re about and an opportunity to try something new! I hope you stick around and come back for more! Thank you, thank you, thank you to Noah, Isaac and Benedict for driving this weekend, this trip simply would not have been possible without you. Noah, you are a legend for dealing with that metal sh*tbox (Fig.55). And finally, massive thank you to the committee for making this trip happen and dealing with issue after issue. It wasn’t the easiest trip to kick off the year, but we got everyone there and back and even managed some climbing along the way, so that’s a W.\nFigure 55: The man, the myth, the legend: Noah Hellen.\n","date":"2025-10-24T00:00:00Z","image":"YAYAYA/YAYAYA/YAYAYA/p/freshers-trip-2025/images/IMG_3057_hu_f8596491f8b8336b.webp","permalink":"YAYAYA/p/freshers-trip-2025/","title":"Fresher's trip 2025"},{"content":"Written by: Miguel Boland\nTrip attendees: Amy (co-organiser) Amar Sophia Sofia Srdanovic (co-organiser) Elaine Stelios Alex W.

I was meeting Amy and Sofia before the rest of the group arrived for our 6am departure. Amy was the driver, and Sofia lived next-door so was hitching a ride with her to Beit in the minibus.\n“Right, well I can’t locate the driver,” Sofia texted me from her flat, with the minibus packed and ready outside. We soon realised that Amy wasn’t going to wake up any time soon, and because of Amy’s industrial-strength earplugs, the doorbell wouldn’t suffice. Sofia tried knocking on Amy’s bedroom window with a broomstick, but it didn’t reach. Thinking quickly, she grabbed the clip-stick from the minibus and while I kept calling Amy’s phone, Sofia leant out of her own bedroom window and smacked Amy’s window with the clip-stick.\nMeanwhile, the rest of the climbers slowly gathered at Beit, groggy and cold, with Asha and Luane looking particularly rough since they had been here, at the student’s union bar, only a few hours earlier. Finally, Amy texted. Turns out the alarm she was relying on was set for weekdays only. Twenty minutes later, the minibus arrived with Amy, hair straight out of bed and toothpaste still on her face, apologising profusely for the mild fiasco. By some miracle, we hit the road at 6.20am.\nWe had one quick stop at the services on the way to Portland to freshen up where everyone, now slightly more awake from their coffees, was able to introduce themselves (we decided it was still too early for a “Say one fun fact about yourself!” type of icebreaker, so stuck to just names and pronouns). To maximise daylight hours, we drove straight to the crag carpark. Pads on our backs, we headed down to Cuttings Boulderfield. Even though it wasn’t my first time taking this approach, the sight of the sea emerging as you walk beneath the ruins of a castle bridge still took my breath away. We paused for a safety brief from Asha, as for many of us (me included), it was our first time bouldering outdoors. In hindsight, we probably should’ve done this where there was a better phone signal, because the next 20 minutes were spent trying to send screenshots of the topos from Amy’s RockFax to everyone.\nWe hit the rocks with a few good hours of daylight left, though, even with Asha’s countless trips here, we still managed to miss the turn into the boulderfields. I was super proud to top out my first outdoor boulder, “Hammer Time” (4), considering how terrified I had been. Katy, Amelia, Shuyi and Rafi also conquered their first outdoor boulders. Some of us had a go at the notoriously difficult mantel on “Pinky Power” (6a/7a depending on the start), climbing the tree next to try find any holds on the top.\nAs the sun dipped below the horizon and the air grew cooler, my heart warmed at the roar of cheers from a few boulders away. I turned to see Amy topping out on “Smash ‘n’ Grab, sit start” (6b), the problem she’d been working on all day. Her hands were caked with blood, dirt, and tattered tape, yet a wide smile stretched across her face, mirrored by the grins of everyone cheering her on. With headlamps on, we wrapped up the session with some night bouldering, each of us taking a crack at “Global Underground” (5+), as Rafi finally found the “razor-sharp crimp” we’d all been hunting for.\nBack at the bunkhouse, it was time to make dinner, and I was in charge of making daal. Usually, I would just eyeball the quantities to make a few portions, so spent way too long trying to figure out how many lentils were enough for 14 people (I ended up making way too much, but at least we know for next time). Seven cups of lentils and a few burnt naans later we enjoyed a lovely meal, and I had a newfound respect for Sofia for all her trip dinners I had taken for granted in the past.\nWe settled in for a quick board game before bed, but as we were setting up, Shuyi walked in, looking distraught. She had lost her phone, which had been in her hand just moments before. The group rallied together to help search for it, and what felt like hours (though it was probably less than one) was spent combing every corner of the bunkhouse. Asha and Daphné even checked under the toilet seat. In a moment of desperation, I turned on the tap, half-hoping the phone would magically appear from the pipes. Finally, Sofia discovered it, hiding deep in the sofa which had already been searched through three times. With the mystery solved, we all headed to bed, exhausted after a long day.\n17/11/2024 After warm showers and a restful night in actual beds (yes, this was the boujee trip), everyone fuelled up on overnight oats before heading to Lost Valley for some sport climbing. Nestled in an idyllic valley, it was completely empty except for us and the robins. We got climbing right away, while Luane, still not recovered from Friday night, napped on a crashpad.\nAmelia and Felicia crushed their first outdoor lead climbs, while boulderers Ella and Rafi were introduced to ropes and heights. Sofia was confronted by “Flake Away” (4a), a climb she had NOT enjoyed on her last visit. Facing her demons, she conquered the climb, and almost everyone managed to snap a cool photo sitting at the top of the flake. Halfway up “Robin Crack” (5b), I found a creature nestled amongst dirty cobwebs right where I wanted to use the crack. I freaked out, thinking it was a centipede, and bailed. Sofia later confirmed it was, in fact, a snail.\nWhilst I was searching for a place to pee, I spotted Amy emerging from the bushes, baby wipes in hand and looking a little shaken. It seemed last night’s daal hadn’t agreed with her stomach. To make matters worse, she hadn’t realised her chosen spot was right at the base of a boulder.\nSofia adored one of the moves on “The Dark End of the Street” (6a+) and encouraged me to try it (it was as cool as she said). We found a rock with a stunning view of the sea and cliffs, where we soaked in the vastness between climbs. On the way back to the minibus, the purple sky darkened, and we were treated to a blazing sunset at the top of the hill where we were parked. Luane decided she hadn’t had enough climbing and began scaling the minibus to get a better view, with a couple of us spotting her nervously. We stopped at Codfathers for fish and chips (or, in Asha’s and my case, vegan chili con carne and breaded mushrooms). Felicia wished she\u0026rsquo;d asked how large the “large cod” was before ordering—it was, in her words, quite large indeed. Asha and I wished we hadn’t ordered the breaded mushrooms because they were, in our words, bad.\nOn the drive home, we reflected on the trip, sharing our two stars and one wish. Many loved how kind, supportive, and safe the trip felt and wished there were more gender-inclusive events like this (looks like I’ve got work to do!). Ella was inspired to learn to belay, and Merve was just thankful for the real beds (a luxury after the usual floor-sleeping on ICMC trips).\nI was grateful for the fact it didn’t rain once (a rare feat in November) and felt proud to have run my first trip. It was a full-circle moment, as Asha’s Gender-Inclusive trip last year had been my first time climbing outdoors, and I couldn’t help but reflect on all the amazing ICMC friends and memories I had made since then.\n","date":"2024-11-16T00:00:00Z","image":"YAYAYA/YAYAYA/YAYAYA/p/womens-and-gender-inclusive-trip-to-isle-of-portland/images/cover_photo_hu_dba8ea624690e5a0.JPG","permalink":"YAYAYA/p/womens-and-gender-inclusive-trip-to-isle-of-portland/","title":"Women’s and Gender Inclusive Trip to Isle of Portland!"},{"content":"In September 2024, a group of ICMC climbers went to Scotland with the aim of making first ascents in new crags.

Off to a great start as we had to unload all of this and dump it in the Union office. Other than that, there were no major dramas other than Amy being in charge of sorting out which trad gear was needed - having no clue she decided to bring everything. Meanwhile, Sofia was in big Tesco, trying to figure out what an appropriate amount of vegan ham was. Goods acquired, we set off on our long long journey to Wye on Valley: travel time, 2.5 hours (minibus speed).\nWe arrived in the village hall only to discover that it did in fact, have a shower. This was after Sofia explicitly told everyone that it didn’t and that they didn’t need towels. As it had turned out that the club didn’t have enough roll mats, the unlucky few fashioned beds out of chairs and ropes and ended up having a decent night sleep.\nThe next morning Sofia excitedly woke everyone up at 7am proclaiming that the weather forecast said it was dry, before actually looking outside and realising we were in a cloud. Back to bed.\nA few hours later, after some overnight oats and caffeination, we set off to find a dry crag. We headed off to Wyndcliff and discovered it did have some dry routes! The top ropers set off to do their first outdoor climbs, the tradders looked for something dry to send, and Amy went straight to the driest route at the crag: “The Arête” 7a+ (obviously).\nWe had a good few hours of climbing in before the rain descended at the exact time that Tom’s weather app said it would. Cat, Marlene, Ruairi, Nik and Maz all did their first outdoor toprope/lead climbs.\nOur close proximity to Bristol meant the natural next step was to go to Bananafingers. We got there shortly before close and the staff were nice enough to stay open a bit longer for us. We left with bank accounts significantly depleted (looking at Marjorie with those E9 trousers ).\nBack in the village hall, Sofia got started on dinner. She’d learnt from previous mistakes and had gone for a simple meal - tomato and sausage pasta. However, as it turned out, simple did not mean quick. As the tomato sauce simmered away, the games began.\nTable bouldering didn’t last long, after Sofia’s failed attempt and huge bruise put everyone off (sharp corners = bad bouldering table). Talks of a ceilidh the night before ended up with Cat teaching everyone Strip the Willow - no one can argue that this trip wasn’t a cultural experience. The hall descended into chaos with people being flung around left right and centre - the hallmarks of a good ceilidh. Ruairi brought out his camp councillor skills and got us to play a bunch of games like the 7 year olds that we are. We soon ran out of energy (typical of both children and pensioners) so it was time for film night.\nA bunch of people all drinking Inch’s ciders meant that Amy just drank whenever she came across a can and quickly got drunk. As soon as the climbing films started she was fast asleep. After simmering for hours and hours, the tomato sauce was FINALLY ready at like 10pm but somehow Merve missed out when the pack descended on dinner so Chef Marjorie quickly whipped up another batch.\nThe next day we were met with beautiful sunshine. We decided to split the group - Amy and Sofia taking the sport climbers to Cheddar Gorge and Elliot leading the charge with the hardcore trad climbers, off to explore hard climbs in Goblin Combe.\nWe probably should’ve turned round as soon as we crossed the bridge into England and were met with heavy mist… Lesson learnt: the weather at the crag might not be the same as at the accom 😬\nThe sport climbers arrived at Cheddar Gorge to the sight of flood water being drained from the cave. The entire crag was sopping wet with zero chance of drying. :( The trad boys didn’t fare any better - even the cave was wet. After some deliberation, we decided to leave Cheddar Gorge and its cheddar cheese ice cream (?) and head back to Wales.\nThe boys decided to call it quits and head to Reading Parthian climbing centre to get some guaranteed dry climbing. Trad team: 0; UK weather: 1. At least the Parthian proved to be a fantastic centre and they had a great afternoon trying out boulders.\nThe sport climbers somehow struck luck on arrival at Wintour’s Leap, where it was lovely and sunny. However, as no one had been to Wintour’s Leap before, Sherpa Sofia led the sheep down the horrendously muddy and slippy long approach that is NOT the quickest way to the sport crag. This involved 45 mins of slipping and stomping through the mud downhill, uphill and through a bog. Amy’s freshly washed 70m long poo rope (another long story) did not survive the journey unscathed.\nShockingly when we arrived at the crag, the rock was surprisingly dry given just how much rain had fallen the night before. Everyone managed to get a couple of climbs in. The quarry proved reliably chossy, and Marlene caught a huge rock headed straight for Lucas’s head (somehow this moment was captured on film).\nPretty much everyone tried their hand at the world’s hardest 6a+. Once Amy tried and failed we concluded that there must have been a broken off hold - UKC comments agree. Sofia and Amy went to tackle what they thought was a breezy 25m 6a+. Despite not finding it all that simple, Amy gaslit Sofia into thinking she was seriously struggling with “it’s not even a bad 6a+”. Further consultation of UKC determined it was a new route, 6b/+ 😵‍💫\nWe had a beautiful sunset and group photo at the top of the crag (fans of Sex Education might recognise). We discovered there was a much easier way to access the crag 🫠 Luckily for all but Amy, this meant that the group was far from the minibus so they got to go chill in the pub whilst the minibus was retrieved.\nThe night sky was beautiful, and we spent an hour drinking our pints and stargazing. Marlene and Sofia were pointing out constellations and satellites, and Maz was overwhelmed with the beauty and the vastness of the cosmos.\nAll in all, a very good trip despite the weather.\n","date":"2024-02-20T00:00:00Z","image":"YAYAYA/YAYAYA/YAYAYA/p/wye-valley-weekend-trip/cover_hu_2c02aea11a45dcb1.jpg","permalink":"YAYAYA/p/wye-valley-weekend-trip/","title":"Wye Valley weekend trip"},{"content":"Written by: Asha\nTrip Report The absolutely epic ICMC Women \u0026amp; Gender Inclusive trip went ahead to the Isle of Portland in November!\nNo matter the level of experience, all were welcome, so as you can imagine the vibes were impeccable with some people excited to outdoor climb for the first time and others returning to crush their projects.\nA special thanks to Rockfax for giving us access to their guidebook for the start of the year and Tenzing for the high energy!\nHighlights Asha’s Two Stars:\nBeing rescued by Amy and Sofia’s 10/10 trad anchor at the top of Neddyfield’s in the dark after my locking carabiner wouldn’t unlock!

Minibuses acquired, but not intact. To our disappointment, the front headlight wasn’t working. Fortunately, old man Miguel was still around to save the day. Having found a spare headlight bulb, the next challenge was our lack of tools. And so began the hunt for the elusive Allen key. A passing cyclist had one key and it was exactly the one we needed. Amy’s key promptly snapped, Gil got a toolkit from Aero but none fit, and neither did Scuba\u0026rsquo;s. Eventually the uni contractors came with a proper toolkit and helped Miguel disassemble the entire headlight to access the bulb. Success!\nHeadlight fixed, we thought we were good to go. Upsettingly for Amar, having both Scuba and ICMC leaving at the same time led to an unfortunate case of misplaced luggage. Amar’s bag, and all his gear, had set off for Cornwall. After an impressive attempt at cyber stalking through social media, the bag was intercepted before it had made it to the M25.\nMeanwhile, oblivious to the chaos occurring in Beit Quad, Elliot and Sofia were busy buying Tesco out of all of their food. An obscene number of veggie sausages (would never have been allowed during pandemic rationing times) and 300 club card points later, it was go time. The journey to the Peak District was uneventful, although Sophia’s minibus had no heating or radio which made for a somewhat unpleasant 3 hours.\nArriving at the village hall at midnight, we had a bit of a shock when we saw the “kitchen facilities”: a singular oven, a microwave and a boiling water tap. Not ideal for Chef Elliot who had planned a delicious dinner of bangers and mash, crispy cabbage, peas and red onion gravy. He went to bed that night, cogs turning, trying to work out how he’d pull it off - but not before making overnight oats for 30 people.\nHaving assessed the weather the night before (not good), we decided that Saturday would start with a lie in. Overnight oats proved to be a huge success (would recommend to all future trips). It was then time for a theory lesson from Gil and Miguel, top tier trad dads. We then set off for New Mills Tor, which UKC assured us would, “stay dry, even in monsoon weather”.\nSplitting into our teaching pairs, we spent the rest of the day learning gear placements, abseiling, and most people managed to get their first second in! The crag was very well protected, and had a decent range of trad, bouldering and sport routes for an aqueduct bridge in the middle of a village. Tom Mills (Tom Tom) sent Grim Reaper Direct (f7A+), a spicy little no-topout problem.\nNo fireworks for us, as half the group decided to stay for some night climbing (thank you street lamps), and the other returned to get started on the ordeal that would be Saturday night dinner. It was a real team effort beautifully conducted by Chef Elliot - with Maja microwaving kilos upon kilos of potatoes, Sean stacking sausages beautifully, MORE\nThe night’s activities involves a competitive cereal box game, followed by the sling game, where two players have to pass through a knotted sling placed around their feet on the floor. Sean and Wilson got very VERY close, Sofia was kicked in the face by Amy, lots of spotting practice occured.\nOn the second day, Amy sent her first HVS (second ever trad lead!) on Tody\u0026rsquo;s Wall. Despite some very neat mantle and crack climbing, the highlight was definitely setting a nut so aggressively that the club’s president wasn’t sure what she was doing (eyewitnesses report it looking like a baby shaking a rattle), and then promptly raining nuts down the route. A good learning experience! Amy was also then filmed shouting, “I’M FINE!”, at onlookers warning her that she was runout halfway up the crack. Still a send.\nMany other climbers got their first taste of the sharp end of trad, without any major incidents as far as we have heard!\n","date":"2023-11-03T00:00:00Z","image":"YAYAYA/YAYAYA/YAYAYA/p/peaks-trip-report-2023/cover_hu_86c96e07df2b2b5.jpg","permalink":"YAYAYA/p/peaks-trip-report-2023/","title":"Peaks Trip Report 2023"},{"content":" Video credits: Zak Leek\n","date":"2023-10-20T00:00:00Z","image":"YAYAYA/YAYAYA/YAYAYA/p/freshers-trip-2023/cover_hu_2b5bea3c01ff1b98.jpg","permalink":"YAYAYA/p/freshers-trip-2023/","title":"Fresher's trip 2023"},{"content":"Members Oliver Tippett Chorley King George Gunn Alex Weir Jake Lewis Report The full Expedition report can be found here: Expedition report\n","date":"2023-09-01T00:00:00Z","image":"YAYAYA/YAYAYA/YAYAYA/p/yosemite-2023-expedition/cover_hu_ee49f737a07f9f47.jpg","permalink":"YAYAYA/p/yosemite-2023-expedition/","title":"Yosemite 2023 Expedition"},{"content":"Overview A month-long trip to practise alpine climbing skills for future expeditions.\nMembers Piers Heathcote Tom Stringer Ben Schuster Reuben Cruise Nick Koukoulekidis Elliot Badcock Report The full Expedition report can be found here: Expedition report\n","date":"2023-08-01T00:00:00Z","image":"YAYAYA/YAYAYA/YAYAYA/p/bugaboos-and-canadian-rockies-2023-expedition/cover_hu_ad0e758c4188b265.png","permalink":"YAYAYA/p/bugaboos-and-canadian-rockies-2023-expedition/","title":"Bugaboos and Canadian Rockies 2023 Expedition"},{"content":"Overview Two weeks of trad climbing, alpine ridges, large multi pitches and sailing around the Lofoten islands (Norway).\nMembers Cosima Graef Gus Cox Rory Rose Katerina Sandoval Luke Cheeseman Viet Pham Ngoc Rou En Lee Miguel Boland Gil Ribeiro Report The full Expedition report can be found here: Expedition report\n","date":"2023-08-01T00:00:00Z","image":"YAYAYA/YAYAYA/YAYAYA/p/lofoten-2023-expedition/cover_hu_81d6498562330044.jpg","permalink":"YAYAYA/p/lofoten-2023-expedition/","title":"Lofoten 2023 Expedition"},{"content":"Overview A month-long trip to practise alpine climbing skills for future expeditions.\nMembers Supported by Explo Board Isaac Blanc Ed Adams Sam Bakker Ben Jones Self-funded George Gunn Chorley King Big Strong James Gibson Miranda Dobson Report The full Expedition report can be found here: Expedition report\nHere is an extract describing our time climbing the Lion Ridge on the Matterhorn:\nIsaac called an early morning (midday) meeting at the operations room (bakery) to discuss plans for the coming days.

This section was by far the highest quality: free of fixed gear, technical and exposed, but never difficult.

It is a region full of beautiful unclimbed rock and stunning scenery. Very few locals climb, this hampers the growth of the sport as there are very few people who have the skills to develop climbing areas and inspire people to take up the sport. In 2015 the Extreme Club in Banja Luka created the ‘Drill \u0026amp; Chill’ Festival. This sought to bring experienced climbers and highliners from all over the world to the region to develop new climbing routes and to celebrate the unique culture within the sport. Since then it has grown from strength to strength, and is responsible for the development of over 350+ new routes. The festival is located in the beautiful Canyon Tijesno on the outskirts of Banja Luka. It contains some of the region’s finest climbs, with sport routes ranging from easy 5+, to a near impossible 9a as well as a range of adventurous multipitches. The canyon is also ideally suited for highlines, ranging from 35m in length to a regional record breaking 705m line. As well as the climbing the festival has a range of workshops, ranging from juggling and traditional embroidery to acro-yoga and aerial silk. The festival also runs a free bolting course, teaching competent climbers how to develop and bolt new routes.\nObjectives The team was keen to experience the beautiful scenery and climbing the region has to offer as well as contribute to the development of the sport in the region. Developing crags and bolting your own route is something that is near impossible in the UK as the climbing scene is very mature and potential sites saturated. Some team members were psyched on creating their own route and developing the local scene, others wanted to push themselves on highlines and all were keen on enjoying the delights of Bosnian limestone. A few wanted to progress into multipitch climbing. Some just wanted to chill after a stressful summer of high frequency trading at one of the city’s top cream sucking firms.\nThe Team Name Role Course George Gunn Supreme Commander Des-Eng Elliot Badcock Mr Badcock PhD in numbers Jake Lewis Caffeine Scout PhD in very fast air Tim Bickerseth Chief Chiller Geology Liam Gallagher Cream Sucker EIE Alisha Oner Networking Biochemistry Victor Szwarcberg Barbie Custodian Bioengineering James Gibson Strong Maths William Lovett-Turner Psyche Dealer Geology Tour Overview Day 0 Alisha and Tim were keen beans and flew out a day ahead of the main crowd, most of whom were working on Friday. The extortionate cost of roaming data meant their trail went cold shortly after crossing the border into Bosnia.\nDay 1 The main pack congregated at Liverpool Street for an early train out to Stanstead. Will and Elliot managed to blag a lift from relatives and so missed out on the egg \u0026amp; bacon breakfast McMuffin. After clearing security, the group stopped off for some light refreshments. Boarding the plane was hairy as some members of the group had come up with creative ways of maximising their hand luggage allowances, much to the dismay of the Ryanair staff. After a short argument Will had managed to convince them that a helmet was an item of clothing, and his roll mat was simply a blanket.\nTwo uneventful hours later we landed in Zagreb. After getting confused by local taxis we made it to the bus stop. George put his incredibly poor Croatian language skills to use and convinced the bus driver that we had 7 tickets through some broken Czech and vigorous hand gestures. We boarded and headed off towards the border. The 8 Bosnians on the bus promptly started smoking creating a veiling haze and giving most members a migrane.\nWe arrived in Banja Luka a few hours later and stocked up on provisions for the week. We got lucky and managed to stumble upon the only taxi driver in Banja Luka who also climbed and happened to know where the festival was. 40 minutes later we were cruising down the dirt road to the festival site. Upon arrival the group was pleased to find Alisha and Tim, both alive and well.\nDay 2 The group were psyched to get going. Jake was starting to panic as we hadn’t found any gas for our stove the day before. Will attended the bolting course theory session. 2 hours of PowerPoint presentations later he worked out bolting was a lot of effort and promptly decided that 5 days of manual labour was not the optimal way to spend a tour. So much for developing the local climbing scene. At least his trad climbing ethical standards are still intact. Jake and George went off to charm a fellow festival attendee into boiling some water for a brew. Upon the first sip of the coffee Jake realised we had bought the most disgusting beans possible, but soldiered on for his caffeine fix, rubbing the remaining grounds into his gums to little added effect. After this it was discovered the camp had a Snack-bar run by Vito, a local legend, who served coffee at reasonable prices. Jake had never been happier.\nThe group spent the rest of the morning day getting acquainted with the site, visiting all the crags and highline spots. Sector ‘Amfiteatar’ proved to be the most inspiring with its stunning setting and steep overhanging walls. Sadly grades started at 6c+ and topped out at Interklemezzo - 9a a route bolted by Adam Ondra, the team decided some warm up routes were needed. After lunch a contingent headed out to sector Vito, where Liam, James, Will and Elliot enjoyed the pleasant at the grade ‘Living La Vito Loca’ – 6a and the slightly chossy ‘One hand minus’ – 5b.\nTim enjoyed soaking up the chilled atmosphere and continued to make friends with the other festival goers at the camp. George, Jake, Alisha and Victor and ventured out to the 35m highline to test their mettle. Each taking turns to roll out into the middle of the line and soak up the exposure. Jake was mesmerised by the 200m of open air below him, so much so he decided climbing was actually a rubbish sport and he was going to become a highliner instead. George, who had previous highline experience was reminded how painful sitting on the 1” webbing was, especially for the duration of time it took to compose himself before attempting to stand up. He never stood a chance and fell straight off. This would become a recurring theme throughout the week.\nThe team congregated for dinner, refreshed from the previous days travel and thoroughly psyched for the week ahead.\nDay 3 Day 3 started with the team attending a functional breathing workshop. Tim, Alisha, Victor and especially Will getting invested in the practice. George and Jake were finding it hard to keep a straight face as the coach explained the kidneys stored all the soul’s trauma, over the sound of 50 hyperventilating climbers. They made a B-Line for Vito’s to get their morning caffeine fix.\nJames, Will, Victor, Elliot and Alisha headed out to sector Krilo and finally found some rock that was more secure. Some highlights of the day include ‘Paprika’ – 5c which all the team managed to tick, whilst strong James eased back in after an injury by climbing ‘Dirty Dan’ – 6B which was then repeated by Victor and Will. Over at the highlines, George, Jake and Liam were making progress towards their goal of standing up. This involved a lot of falling followed by an equal amount of shouting. The Trio decided to mask their inadequacy and build their confidence by hanging upside-down from the lines instead of walking them.\nAfter regrouping at dinner, the team prepared themselves for a big night: the drill and chill Triathlon. This team event involved a timed race across 3 disciplines: rope coiling, 10 pullups and drinking a beer whilst on a slackline. Sadly we did not make it out of the selection phase and were forced to watch from the side-lines. The team quickly forgot this disappointment and started enjoying the rest of the evening. To add to the misery, DJ Baba Djex was unable to make it and instead we were treated to a evening of Jawharp music. This was complemented nicely by a substantial quantity of local brandy known as ‘Rakia’. Jake and Elliot seemed to lose themselves in the tribal tones as the team danced the evening away. Tim’s networking earlier in the week paid dividends as he was offered a shot on the stage playing a jaw harp. He did the team proud, and despite not attracting the attention of any record labels on his debut, he held his own.\nDay 4 Nursing a slight headache from the day before, the team decided to make the most of the workshops on offer and take a rest day. After two visits to Vito’s Jake was just about feeling human again and the pack headed to the forest chill zone. Here a large space net was found, and the team proceeded to do very little for the next few hours.\nThe first workshop of the day was in the art of Aerial Silk acrobatics. The team took to this like ducks to water. After a few pointers, Will was able to string together a series of moves, taking in two elegant poses whilst fully embracing his inner swan. He swiftly forgot the details for the subsequent move and ended tying himself in a knot on the floor and in need of a rescue.\nThe group then ventured to the highlines in an attempt to do something with the day. Victor and Tim made their maiden voyage out onto the lines, whilst Liam struck up a conversation with some people playing the guitar. Tim later leveraged his newfound musical reputation to form a band with them, and they promptly released their first single “like a butterfly”. This went down a treat, with the rest of the highliners joining in for the chorus. Rumor has it their EP drops in early December.\nThat evening a classic Bosnian film was shown in camp. It covered the trials and tribulations of two pioneering Bosnian hip-hop artists as they navigated their way through failed relationships to fame in Yugoslavia. Whilst not suitable for the British cinema industry, it didn’t stop a few team members from having a good chuckle.\nDay 5 The objective of the day was to climb a route bolted by George the year prior, ‘Crack and forth’ – 6a+. The team headed out to sector Jazbina, only to find the sector shut and the bolting course attendees hanging 30m above our heads. A swift retreat to sector Vito followed. George, Victor and Alisha enjoyed excursions up the delighful ‘Veni, Vidi, Vito’ – 6a and the less delightful ‘Livin la vito loca’ – 6a+. Will, James and Liam kept themselves occupied and tackled the more difficult ‘Einfach Tapfer Sein’ – 6b. Jake and Elliot had a hairy experience on ‘Illatos Olomos’- 4+ which seemed to have more trees than a medium sized arboretum. This killed their psyche for the day and they headed back to camp to further develop their aerial silk skills. George and Victor later tried to repeat Einfach Tapfer Sein but to little success. The team returned to camp and enjoyed a traditional local cabbage soup dinner with accompanying burek.\nDay 6 The team was full of psyche on the last full day. With reports of bad weather brewing in the afternoon they set off early to make the most of the day. Shortly after setting off the wind and rain rolled in. The window in Will and James’ tent decided it was the perfect opportunity to detach itself, leaving an 8” hole for the menacing rain. As any self-respecting engineer would do, George decided the obvious answer was duct tape and a Sainsburys bag. 10 minutes later the tent was good as new, Will initially doubted the repairs integrity, however preferred this to the porta-loo alternative.\nThankfully the rain packed quickly, and after a few hours of drying we headed out back to the rock. Victor took the opportunity to take climbing barbie to new heights on ‘Honeymoon Suite’ - 6a, whilst George got to the top of the route he bolted the year before ‘Crack and Forth’. The send train was then left the station with Will, Victor, Liam and James also ticking the route. Jake pushed himself and ticked ‘Toxic MascuGINity’ – 5c as did Elliot shortly after.\nThe pack then headed to Sector Amfiteatar for the afternoon. Will was keen to try something hard and hoped on ‘Hustensaft’ – 6c+, which he onsighted, but not without a few expletives. Strong James not to be outdone, then repeated the route. George and Victor raced up ‘Good boy’ – 6b. George, Jake, Liam and Tim had one more go on the highlines and failed to make any significant progress. Before they could get a second attempt the wind picked up and the lines started oscillating, they figured it was safer to retreat to the camp and get a beer.\nDue to the weather the goodbye party was moved a day earlier, and the team took full advantage. After getting bored of the light show, Elliot embraced his inner ‘Mr Badcock’ and put his PGCE to good use by organising a festival wide game of hide and seek. None of the team got lost and we quickly congregated around the slacklines to attempt some night slacking. This was unsuccessful, with most of the team making fools of themselves.\nDay 7 The team awoke to it chucking it down. It was clear nothing was going to climbed that day, and packed the tents down in misery. We then said our goodbyes and left the festival site. Tim decided to cancel his flight and venture onwards to a Hungarian Jawharp festival with his new friends Bruno, Dan and Sophie. The remainder of the pack got back on the early bus to Zagreb. We stashed our bags at the station and decided to explore what Zagreb had to offer. After finding the main cathedral was under repair, Liam and James decided to flip a coin at each junction they encountered to explore the less visited parts of the city. The remainder of the pack ventured to a park, where Elliot climbed the final route of the trip ‘Playground’ - 7c+, then decided we needed to find a pub. Luckily James and Liam’s coin had a similar idea, and the group congregated to reminisce about the tour. We then headed to Zagreb airport and found a comfortable corner to setup camp for the night.\nDay 8 With the sound of ‘please do not leave your baggage unattended’ being blared over the tannoy every 15 minutes, it’s safe to say the team did not find themselves well rested in the morning. After boarding the flight most passed out to recoup the lost sleep. We landed in London and went our separate ways.\nFootnote: After a further 10 days cruising around Europe with his new friends, Tim safely returned to London to continue his geology degree.\nConclusion \u0026amp; Lessons Learnt Overall, the tour was a massive success. Everyone had pushed themselves either through climbing or highlining. The team developed new skills in the art of aerial silk, embroidery, juggling, acro-yoga and music. Liam returned more chilled than ever before and ready to suck some more cream. Most importantly, the team were all exposed to opportunities they would not have had within the UK. The outdoor climbing experience of group members was significantly improved, and all were exposed to highlining for the first time.\nDespite all the things achieved, we did not completely fulfil our aims. Many had wanted to climb some multi-pitch routes. The multipitch routes in the canyon rarely get climbed, leading to lots of vegetation growing in the holds, and the routes remaining ‘dirty’. This makes them much harder than the grade indicated. They are also quite committing with an abseil in approach meaning the route needs to be climbed in full to get back to the camp. The team all displayed sound judgement and adapted their aims to ones that could be achieved safely, an attitude that is a credit to them. I would recommend all future tour leaders to not be afraid of changing plans based on the conditions you find on the ground.\nFuture Development There is a strong desire within the club to do more highlining. Since returning we have acquired a slackline for the club so members can develop these skills in London. Building on this another tour to a highline venue could be a possibility in the years going forward.\n","date":"2022-09-17T00:00:00Z","image":"YAYAYA/YAYAYA/YAYAYA/p/drill-and-chill-summer-tour-2022/cover_hu_2d02d534cc2aa612.jpg","permalink":"YAYAYA/p/drill-and-chill-summer-tour-2022/","title":"Drill and Chill Summer Tour 2022"},{"content":"The full Expedition report can be found here: Expedition report\nExpedition members Oliver Tippett Chorley King Stuart McClune Isabel Jones Alex Smith Ed Chapman ","date":"2022-08-22T00:00:00Z","image":"YAYAYA/YAYAYA/YAYAYA/p/yosemite-expedition-2022/images/_062_hu_9ff40771e2774c22.png","permalink":"YAYAYA/p/yosemite-expedition-2022/","title":"Yosemite expedition 2022"},{"content":"Expedition members Cyrus Goodarzi Dominic Rusch Callum Hargrove Asha Bakhai Laurene Ville William Lovett-Turner Benjamin Jones Hadrien Ville Expedition report\n","date":"2022-08-01T00:00:00Z","image":"YAYAYA/YAYAYA/YAYAYA/p/iceland-expedition-2022/cover_hu_1e0d0890a1c9e2c1.png","permalink":"YAYAYA/p/iceland-expedition-2022/","title":"Iceland Expedition 2022"},{"content":"The full Expedition report can be found here: Expedition report\nExpedition members Isabel \u0026ldquo;Izzy\u0026rdquo; Jones Isaac Blanc Cosima Graef Miguel Boland Ben Jones Jake Lewis Short film of the expedition ","date":"2022-06-30T00:00:00Z","image":"YAYAYA/YAYAYA/YAYAYA/p/alaska-expedition-2022/cover_hu_9a5cbd8a186911e1.png","permalink":"YAYAYA/p/alaska-expedition-2022/","title":"Alaska expedition 2022"},{"content":"ICMC went to Portland\nReport The first trip of 2022 marked the ICMC’s first return to the Isle of Portland, Dorset since 2018. A lack of cheap accommodation (or motivation for camping) brought any previous plans to a standstill. This was changed by Vice-Pres George, who went above the call of duty by randomly dialling phone numbers in the Dorset region until he found a church hall for hire under the house of a vicar.\nMiguel making a barefoot crack ascent of Chalkie and the Hex 5 (5a) \u0026lsquo;for fun\u0026rsquo;\nA few messages later and members rushed to buy tickets for what promised to be a cracking weekend of sport and bouldering. President Ollie Tippett gravely missed access to the union minibuses after his own van broke down before getting out of his driveway. Although he missed the trip he was there in spirit, as all present could feel his sarcastic comments like some form of undiagnosed PTSD. The remaining members made their way to the Isle in good order, and George rapidly organised the hire of bouldering pads to replace those lost in Ollie’s van.\nLiam repeating the bare-footed ascent.\nFollowing a reasonable night’s sleep (one unidentified snorer must have slept well!), the club rose to start a solid day’s climb in the cuttings. Whilst Ciaran and George headed off to fetch the hire pads, the rest of the trip warmed up on some of the easier sport routes offered in the cuttings and revised some anchor-rethreading theory. Upon their return with said pads, some boulderers (who shall not be named) (Callum) declared sport climbing to be a fruitless endeavour, and led a group down to the Cuttings boulder field.\nThe boulderers had a strong day, with Asha, Callum and Jake (minus one foot) sending Anasazi Lost (7A), Callum sending Lightning Strike (7A+), and Asha and Jake sanding their hands down on Relativity (7A) to no avail. A larger group joined them from the upper cliffs to send Days of Colour (6A).\nThe sport climbers moved on from the warmup to tackle various harder routes, namely Too Many Cooks (6b), Mousefolk (6c), Evening Mistress (6b). Rory made quick work of the Mermaid (7a), encouraging many others to follow suit (with more beta and fewer attempts; Will). Scarlett and Daisy worked their way around increasingly bold routes around the crag, culminating in a plan to multi-pitch some routes in the Bower buttress (see later on). Mellisa and Anaya taped up and worked their way up and down the Jam (4c offwidth), seemingly in search of the perfect jamming technique. Max and Mathilde surprised everyone by admitting they had yet to climb outdoors; following a tutoring session with George they went on their merry way and worked their way up the grades on offer around the crag. Will (belayed by Liam) worked on their fall/fall catching practice by working on Mousefolk (6c) and Perihelion (6b+). Despite a skin-sanding fall on the slabby layback of Mousefolk and a complete inverted ragdoll-like swing after the crux of Perihelion, Will walked away unharmed with an added trust in Liam’s belaying.\nRory, Miguel and Ciaran psyched each other up to try out Modern Nightmare (7a), a long (for the cuttings) route split into a stiff bouldery start, a taxing section up a groove and a set of 3 roofs with blind jugs. After figuring out the beta for the boulder (and most importantly realising the first bolt can be pre-clipped with a little jump!), all 3 were shut down by the roofs of the route which proved tricky to read (who would have guessed…).\nThe club made their way back to the vicar’s house for atonements (i.e well earned rests). George expertly directed the kitchen, delivering two excellent chillis (vegi \u0026amp; meat) and impressively heterogenous rice, albeit a power cut to the cooker did almost cause havoc if not for his quick thinking (which will not be described here!). Liam decided the ICMC should instead be the Imperial College Melee Club, and demanded the right to wrestle Miguel in exchange for doing his fair share of the washing up. Pots were washed, crash pads were tesselated and Miguel promptly spent 15 minutes in various headlocks before Liam caught his breath and ended up in an armbar. Excited by the atmosphere, Ciaran and Callum had their own match, which Callum later describes as: “an experience. Interesting.” (interpret this as you wish). After a drawn-out match between Ciaran and Miguel which ended with some sore finger tendons, Liam decided a champion had to be declared and challenged Ciaran to a final match. After a near-instant headlock, the ICMC returned to being a climbing club and Liam put his ambitions to rest (until the next trip!).\nAnother uneventful night’s sleep passed, Ciaran awoke with a slightly bruised nose (on account of Liam’s heels, see picture above) and Miguel’s neck was reduced to 2 axes of motion. Nevertheless, the club got out of the hall and back to the cuttings for another day of hard sends.\nThe boulderers returned to the coast and were joined by a majority of the trip. Highlights of the day include Callum trying Frankenstein (7C) and almost ticking Liquid Sun (7A+) with Asha. Anaya, Melissa, Liam, George, Max, Mathilde, Melissa, Liam and George all joined to send a long series of 5+s and a few first 6As.\nAfter a quick multi-pitch in the Bower (Voices in the Bower, 3 pitch 5a), Rory and Miguel headed to the New Cuttings for a final warm up(Flowers on a Razor Wire 6c), Rory and Miguel before joining Ciaran to return to the Modern Nightmare. Rory disappeared to coach Scarlett and Daisy up the multi-pitch, lying down on top of the crag with his head yelling instructions and inspecting the rope work below with a hawkish gaze. Ciaran took a first stab at Modern Nightmare and almost set the route but fell short at the final roof. Miguel had more luck, sending his 2nd 7a and leaving all of Ciaran’s quickdraws in place as a motivation for his own attempt. However, this was not to be, as multiple attempts to cruise past the opening boulder ended in disappointment for Ciaran. Rory was called upon, but he too was felled by the boulder section despite valiant efforts, leaving Miguel to scream his way back up with ripped hands and retrieve the gear left on route before night fell. All was clear and everyone was safely back on solid ground as the sun began to set.\nAfter a little convincing, a few members headed down to a nearby cove for an improvised dip in the sea. Perhaps we felt better for doing it, but maybe that was just the hypothermia setting in. It may have been lucky that night time was falling as swim wear was sparse and the rest of the club was gathering at the top of the cliff to depart, but no comments were exchanged or needed.\nNotable Events Best Sends Sport:\nRory \u0026amp; Will: The Mermaid, 7a Miguel: Modern Nightmare, 7a Bouldering:\nCallum: Lightning Strike, 7A+ Asha, Callum \u0026amp; Jake (almost): Anasazi Lost, 7A Best Falls Will: Perihilion Will: Mousefolk Best Food George (meat chilli) George (vegi chilli) Various (cereal + milk) Worst Food George (rice) Written by Miguel Boland\n","date":"2022-01-01T00:00:00Z","image":"YAYAYA/YAYAYA/YAYAYA/p/portland-trip-report-2022/cover_hu_39cea0a0adda3d53.jpg","permalink":"YAYAYA/p/portland-trip-report-2022/","title":"Portland Trip Report 2022"},{"content":"Background In direct contrast to the South-East of England, Scotland is a rugged and geologically varied country and plays host to some of the oldest mountains in the world. With such an expansive mountainous environment, some of the most pivotal figures in British mountaineering history have been Scots, such as Harold Raeburn and Sir Hugh Munro (the namesake of Scottish peaks exceeding 3,000 feet).\nScotland’s proximity to maritime and continental polar weather fronts increases the incidence of colder weather and snowfall, with the mountainous regions such as the Cairngorms and Grampian mountains receiving the most, this leads to consistent wintery conditions on the high mountains of Scotland. As such, technical winter climbing utilizing crampons, ice axes, and traditional climbing methods is a common seasonal activity drawing people from across the UK and Europe. Recreational Scottish winter climbing goes back as far as the 1870s with the first ascents of the major gullies on the North face of Ben Nevis, however, it would be another two decades until the first documented ascent of the ultra- classic Tower Ridge (IV,3) in 1894.\nCompared to the Grampians, the northern Cairngorms were delayed in their recreational exploration with significant development only occurring after the turn of the century. Despite this, the audacity of the climbers and (fortunately) success only accelerated, outpacing the development of mountaineering equipment, achieving impressive first ascents such as Point Five Gully (V, 5) and Orion Face Direct (V, 5), both of which are challenging climbs by modern standards, one can only think of the harrowing experience and grave risks that the early mountaineers exposed themselves to. The year 1970 brought about massive change, with the visit of legendary American rock climber Yvon Chouinard bringing the first curved ice axes to the UK, and with their arrival, the limits were further pushed, and the sport further increased in popularity.\nAn unknown climber high on the traverse pitch of Orion Face Direct (V, 5)\nMap of the Cairngorm National Park, with the crags of interest in yellow\nWith the development of the sport throughout the 70s and 80s, the state of the sport started to look more and more like the predecessor to modern winter climbing. With the increased accessibility to, and media surrounding modern high-altitude mountaineering, mountaineering, alpinism, and winter climbing have become more popular than ever, with the mountains of Scotland serving as a valuable training ground for young, up-and-coming alpinists.\nImperial College Mountaineering Club holds a winter climbing meet in the Cairngorms every year, with such skills and experience gained serving as the steppingstones for members to conquer greater objectives, such as student-run expeditions to Alaska’s Alaska Range, and the Monte Rossa Massif in recent years. This trip aims to continue this long history of developing mountaineering skills.\nThe Team Name Role Degree Year Aim Ciaran Dowds Tour Leader / Record holder for fastest run from Ben Macdui to Cairngorm Toilets Electrical Eng 4th Send first Scottish Grade IV in style.

Itinerary Day 1 - Fireside tales 28/12/ A mild London morning greeted us, our recent Christmas festivities were still fresh in our minds, however, those snow-free memories were being quickly replaced with the thought of snow-dusted Scottish valleys, rime-ice-covered rocks, and Icey gullies, but this was not to be the case. The 12 - hour trip was long but never boring, interspersed with stories of winter’s past and our autumnal epics hoping to replicate ICMC’s recent success on trips and be greeted with good weather. Psyche was building the closer we got to the Scottish border, with Jerry Springer and Paolo Nutini creeping their way onto the car stereo with greater frequency, with our Scottish music cultural dive only being interrupted by news from the other car – Olly’s good old unreliable van. Packed with mission-critical gear, Olly and his co-pilot Issy were unsure if there were going to make it to the Cairngorm car park in anything other than a RAC recovery vehicle. Their vehicle was stricken with intense vibrations, however, with only a short wait, the good Samaritan from the RAC fixed the fault which has resulted from the ineptitude of a previous unnamed mechanic, as the front left wheel was not properly attached. That was the last of days’ dramas, with everyone making it to the hut by the early hours of the morning. Upon arrival, equipment was distributed, with Jake taking the fancy of a short ice screw he affectionately named ‘shtubby’, whilst others were fixated on the ancient human ritual of fire lighting.\nDay 2 Route Recon 29/12 The group awoke with a pre-dawn start, a theme that persisted until the end of the trip. With a mix of experience within the group, members with winter climbing experience (Ciaran, Olly, Piers, and Jake) were to go to the northern corries of Stob Coire an t-Sneachda and Cairn Lochan to access conditions, whilst those that didn’t (Alex, Issy, George, Ben) started a 2 - day introductory course ran by Ronald ‘Ron’ Walker, a local legend of the area. Ron is a naturally gifted and successful winter climber, with decades of experience, with outstanding local knowledge to guide clients, and is a keen photographer with many of his wintery shots filling the SMC guidebooks. With the groups splitting up, the learners received an excellent course on winter mountaineering basics, cruising the class and exceeding expectations, however, the same could not be said for the other group. Equipped with fully laden packs, reminiscent of those used for the siege tactics of the early alpinists. After brushing up on rusty winter skills including personal movement and ice axe arrests, they continued walking around to Lochan. Unfortunately, both Sneachda and Lochan had been stripped of snow and ice by the recent high- pressure system that was stubbornly refusing to leave Scotland at the time. The group was disappointed, however, with Jake’s father and his Met Office connections we were informed that a strong low-pressure system was coming soon. Such shifting conditions were on-theme for the season so far, with the Scottish weather largely not cooperating with the needs of the many eager early- season senders. Winds were picking up, with a yellow wind warning for the entire mountain range, but the group was keen to not let the day go to waste. With the winds making any walk up to the Cairngorm plateau too dangerous and frankly too miserable, we set our sights on a smaller peak located North-East of Cairngorm – Castle hill. Standing at only 728 meters, its unimpressive height camouflages it in the rugged background of the range, the only thing more unimpressive, was the difficulty of ascending it that day. Cutting to the peaks’ south, with the wind behind them, the group made the last ascent to the summit with 60mph winds physically lifting them up the entire way. With such winds, Jake and Piers were initially blown past the summit, with Ciaran and Olly having to stand aggressively leaning into the so that they didn’t tumble down the West side of the hill. With the day thoroughly seized, the now wind-battered team regrouped with the novices in Aviemore for chips and deep-fried haggis before heading back to the hut, pondering the potential events of the next day.\nDay 3 - Chasing Phantoms 30/12 Overnight, the weather had turned. High winds had given way to torrential showers high on the Munros. Ron opted to push the second day of teaching back to the next day, and with the group wanting to make the most of their time in the mountaineering capital of the UK, we headed for the Cummingston on the sun-baked eastern coast. Cummingston, with a microclimate that typically opposes that of the inner mountains of Scotland, is a wet weather venue where one can retreat to for coastal sea cliff single- pitch trad climbing. However, our bad luck continued, the venue was thoroughly soaked with even the supposedly ‘weatherproof’ cave dripping wet. We regrouped at the car park with the group only given one last potential objective – the Cummingston car park playground. It contained legendary rides including the spinning top, giant roundabout, and the UKC checklist-approved gem of ‘the crag’ the Metal Slide on the approach to Cummingston Grade – I. Jake, with his low center of mass and strong bouldering background, flashed the problem, pinching the sides of the metal slide and brute forcing his way to the top. Piers, having been unsuccessful during his previous visits attempted the same, however, it was not to be, and Piers was forced to console his failure on the other rides. Though if asked, he would never admit it, it was Piers’ highlight of the trip.\nBy now, word has spread amongst the group of a mythical truly weatherproof venue - Cauldron Rocks. Located in Findhorn Gorge and only a short drive South-West of Cummingston, we made haste to the crag to maximize the short winter day. Upon arrival, it became apparent that lacking a local map, accurate approach notes, and – for some – a sense of direction that the crag would be almost impossible to find. The group, led by George and Ben descended the correct gorge and eventually found the unassuming boulders, but surprise surprise, they too were wet. Defeated, the group made for the car park only to stop and for Olly and Ciaran to climb an impressive tree that would make for a high-quality bivvy spot high off of the forest floor. With the rest of the group thoroughly impressed and in need of chalk for our sweaty palms, we headed home, picking up Isaac on the way from Aviemore station.\nDay 4 - Fingers Ridge Fools 31/12 The fourth day started with the group splitting for the last time, the novices would complete their final day of training with Ron, whilst the other 5 would ascend the highest mountain in the range – Ben Macdui. With air temperature approaching double digits, and the rain thoroughly stripping all but the deepest of gullies of their snow, the group used the approach to assess the damage in Sneachda and see if anything had survived. Walking to the base of the corrie, and ascending the goat track to the plateau, the group was amazed to see a fully kitted up party roping up to attempt Fingers Ridge (IV 5) with the route being so bear, not even Page 3 would consider exploiting its currently naked state for individual gain. Olly mentioned the complete disregard for ethics, however, the rest were too absorbed in ascending the goat track, for it was the first time most has donned crampons and axes in over a year. Once on the plateau, the team made quick work of walking to the summit of Ben Macdui, only stopping for the tourist pastime of summit photos, and trying to glissade down the northern slopes by any means. With the visibility becoming worse, the quintet hastened their descent to the car park, taking the western path down Lochan, with Ciaran setting an unachievable pace that the others could not match. The reason for such pace was not his concern for the safety of the party due to the hazardous low visibility, but his concern for the safety of his underwear. The pace of his descent was so impressive that we believed it was a new speed record for a running (interspaced with waddling) descent of Ben Macdui to the Cairngorm Car Park toilets.\nThe entertainment continued during the car ride back to the hut, with Olly – a concerned environmentalist – taking to the UKC forums to ethical shortcomings of the punters we had seen earlier that day*. Such a post became an instant hotbed of self-righteous climbers appalled by the lack of respect exhibited earlier that day, with such outrage from the community highlighting the strict ethics of British mountaineering, with this time ICMC not on the hot end of the climbing ethics debate (having historically had that one time a student decided to stupidly dry tool a route a millstone, and narrowly escape Sheffield with his identity still unknown.) The post, alongside the boardgames, Scrawl and Set provided the evening’s entertainment for the NYE festivities, climaxing with the official coronation of the incumbent ICMC president.\nThe UKC Post: https://www.ukclimbing.com/forums/winter_climbing/fingers_ridge_fools-742579 Day 5 - Yearly Traditions 01/01/ We awoke, riddled with hangovers and the false promises of a New Year’s Day fry-up. Some particularly fragile members of the group stayed behind to hold the fort, whilst the rest scouted out the nearby crag, Creag Dhubh, just outside Newtonmore. The group managed to go three for three ‘weatherproof’ climbing venues, with the crag still wet from previous rainfall and the spray from the nearby waterfall. At this moment, tired of coming up empty-handed, George and Isaac hatched a plan to climb the rarely sent route Oui Oui beneath the waterfall and vowed to return later that week, clad head to toe in Gore-Tex to climb the unconventional route_._ With the forecast predicting sub zeros temperature for the next day, the evening was spent recovering and preparing to take the novices out on their first proper winter climbs.\nDay 6 - Blowing away the cobwebs 02/01 With the hangovers of New Year’s quickly becoming a distant memory, the group was ready for a passing of the torch from the experienced to inexperienced members. Jacob’s Ladder (I) is renowned for being a particularly stubborn route to disappear, like Raebrun’s Gully (III) and the high gullies (3- 5 (I)) on The Ben, the route can survive all but the most extended and intense heatwaves. The group, keen to oil their old rusty winter skills, made haste with an early start as it was likely many other parties were going to rely on ol’ reliable that day. Walking into the bottom of Sneachda there was little change in the amount of snow compared to two days prior. The group paired up, roped up, and formed the traditional ‘novice send train’ one typically sees on Jacob’s ladder early season when few other climbs have the depth of snow to be in condition.\nBy the end of the day, everyone had had their taste of Scottish winter climbing at the sharp end, even if the route in question becomes a motorway for soloists looking for a speedy way to reach the top of Sneachda. Alex bumped into some old friends from Durham university whilst leading the route – another repeating theme for the trip. Once at the top, there was little else to do apart from the yearly pilgrimage to the top of Cairn Gorm Mountain. Standing at 1245m, it is one of the highest peaks in Scotland, and the weather station at its summit frequently records the highest winds each year, just standing on the summit that day felt like sticking your head out of a car driving on the motorway! Thoroughly battered and thrilled for one day, the group descended the north-western slopes of Cairn Gorm parallel to the ski slopes, which were packed considering the lack of snowfall, and glissaded their way back down to the Cairngorm café, before being on their way to Aviemore for haggis and chips with a thorough drowning in gravy!\nDay 7 - Nature’s waterslide 03/01 Another uncharacteristically warm day greeted us, with the low-pressure weather band delaying its arrival to the next day, other means of entertainment had to be found. With overnight rains drenching the crags and more precited that morning, many sought refuge in the hut or spent the day making a considerable dent in their maintenance loans with the assistance of the Aviemore shops. George and Isaac had other plans; to scale the waterfall at Craig Dubh. They donned marigolds, and Gore-Tex suits, resembling warriors about to do battle with the waves, and made their way to the crag for their rudimentary rack-cleaning session. The base of the route was receiving a pounding from the forceful waterfall above, the last week of seemingly endless rain and mild temperatures ensured the waterfall was flowing at full force. Isaac tentatively dispatched the first pitch, escaping to the right of the waterfall, and was shielded from the spray by the above overhanging rock. George has the pleasure of leading pitch 2 and was not so lucky. He had to take a direct line diagonally crossing the waterfall, first facing the spray, then the full force of crashing water from the waterfall The rest of the climbing had a unique atmosphere as the waterfall climbing was behind you, and now the route climbed the rock beneath the falling water, with delicate slab climbing moves and the deafening sound of water crashing behind you, it truly was a unique and memorable experience. Reaching the top, thrilled with their accomplishments, Gorge and Isaac prepared and abseil and made it back to the car, escaping benightment. Regrouping at the hut for a relaxing evening, fresh snow had started to fall outside and it was not long before snowball open warfare erupted inside and out, with Issy’s fantastic Welsh being the only thing that could bring the cessation of hostilities.\nDay 8 - Storm Season 04/01 With the potential for our first day of proper winter climbing, Ciaran had green-lit a plan to climb in Sneachda. Unfortunately, with the week taking its toll on everyone, the day’s pre-dawn start had been pushed back later and later as everyone fought for an extra ounce of sleep. High winds from the north bringing heavy snow later in the day meant challenging weather from the get-go, demanding insight, guile, and strategy from the group to pick the routes in the best condition. One had to consider aspects, exposure, and the route’s reliance on frozen turf. Immediately most gullies were ruled out due to the intense wind tunnel effect making upward progress hazardous and frankly miserable, this led to the group settling for the Mess of Pottage buttress, to left (East) of Jacob’s Ladder (I). Arriving at the Cairngorm base station, we stepped out of the cars with fresh crunchy snow underfoot, with a feeling of pensiveness hovering amongst the group; with the car park unusually desolate following early season snowfall, and the challenging conditions underfoot of snow-covered rotten ice, we knew that the conditions would scare off all but the most determined climbers. The walk-in was a challenge, the conditions underfoot combined with the high winds meant that skiing your way off the hardly visible path was a certain, one just hoped to land in the soft heather over a drainage ditch. It quickly became apparent that today’s conditions were not for all, Piers and Alex heeded caution over the conditions and turned back to wait in the Ranger Station Café, with Issy soon to join them. They aimed to join the rest later, hoping that the conditions would lift to provide a weather window for just a pitch or two of a route.\nUnwavered by the wariness of the others, those that persevered split into two groups, with Ciaran, Olly, and Ben aiming for the route Hidden Chimney Direct (IV, 5 ), and George, Jake, and Isaac attempting the open mixed terrain to the left of Jacob’s Ladder, encompassing, The Slant (I), Hidden Chimney (III), and Jacob’s Edge (II). At the base of the route, conditions were just about good enough with the surface turf being frozen and a thin layer of verglas covering the rock face. Ciaran psyched up his crew and attempted the first pitch of Hidden Chimney Direct , with a methodical and confident lead of his first grade IV. Olly successfully followed to the 2nd belay, however, Ben found the conditions challenging and the climbing alien. Having seen Ciaran successfully dispatch pitch 1, the other team wanted to second the first pitch on the top rope but strengthening winds and poor visibility forced both teams to bail and escape up Jacob’s Ladder , vowing to come back the following day.\nDay 9 - Go Hard or Go Home 05/01 The last day of the trip presented the best conditions for the past few weeks. With more fresh snow, the previous evening’s slight thaw, and the already compacted snow from 48 hours ago, the chances of good conditions were high. With the last pre-dawn start behind them, the group made for the Cairngorm car park, with Piers expertly saving his car from fishtailing on the drive to Aviemore, much to the surprise of Olly in the passenger seat. The rewards for our efforts revealed themselves as we were beaten to the car park and the base of the route only by those who had camped the night before. Splitting up into the same groups as three days prior, Olly and Issy broke right from the main trail to Sneachda to attempt the Ficaill Ridge (II), Ciaran and Ben breaking trail to Fluted Buttress to attempt Red Wall (II), with Jake and George in tow, who themselves were to attempt The Runnel (II), leaving Piers, Isaac, and Alex to try Hidden Chimney (III). Approach conditions were difficult; with the snow- loaded western slopes of Fiacaill a’ Choire Chais necessitating a wide birth, groups heading to the eastern side of the corrie were forced to navigate through the boulder field. Progress was slow and tedious, with the fresh snow covering the boulders concealing their true shape, the trail-breakers had to carefully pick their way over and around the boulders, whilst playing a game of minesweeper as their boots risked breaking the ice below and ruining their day entirely. Piers, Issac, and, Alex were joined by another team heading to Mess of Pottage and offered to split the boulder-navigating trail-breaking. Through casual chit-chat, the other team was headed to the same route, however, no queueing was needed, as one of the climbers in their party broke through the ice and flooded both of their boots, forcing a disappointing retreat to the car park.\nAll the teams made it to the base of their routes in good time, and with minimal queuing. Olly and Issy climbed Fiaciall buttress to reach the ridge which had wonderfully varied climbing, allowing the climber to choose the difficulty of the route. They quickly ascended the first pillar of the ridge climbing 30 ft to the main ridge walk and then the final obstacle, the main ridge itself. The most rewarding line is a steep, stepped corner with various mantles which Issy sent with ease, leaving only the walk skirting the corrie rim to reach the other groups further East. One buttress over, Ben and Ciaran were tackling Red Gully on Fluted Buttress. The route takes an obscure line taking the natural fault right of Fingers Ridge (IV, 5). The large narrow chimney at the base was banked with deep snow, giving challenging climbing in the lower section, which continued to climb and increase in difficulty as they progressed. Ciaran led the first pitch with Ben belaying on his knees to spare his feet from the cold snow. After the first pitch, the route takes a dogleg right, taking sustained but easier mixed terrain until it opens out into a funnel-shaped gully near beneath the lip of the plateau above. The pair made constant but slow progress in the challenging conditions and deep snow, and with the setting sun, head torches and sparks from Ciaran’s axe hitting the buried granite rocks lit the way to the top. The group was the last to summit, with both George and Jake on The Runnel, and the Trio on Hidden chimney making light work of their ascents. The Runnel is the striking central gully that sits highest on Fluted Buttress, the long snow-plod into the gully rewards the climbers with beautiful, high-angle ice and neve all the way to the top, leading to a final steep mixed chimney that is the crux of the route.\nJake and George’s efforts were rewarded with good conditions on the lower and middle sections of the route with good ice. Unfortunately, had unfaithfully left Schtubby back in the hut and was upset that he had no screws to place on the route. With both lacking experience leading, they took their time and carefully climbed the route taking in all the pleasures of climbing a crag classic route.\nOnce all the teams had sent their routes, they rendezvoused at the top of Hidden Chimney on Mess of Pottage, and much to the surprise of Isaac, were waiting for him at the topped-out the final pitch. The trio of Isaac, Piers, and Alex had been slowed by their numbers and the need for diligent route finding. Starting the day at the busy base of Jacob’s Ladder, Isaac started up the first pitch which climbs the gully of Jacob’s Ladder for 25m then breaks left, climbing through the natural dip in the left gully wall to gain the vast buttress. The deep snow complicated gear finding and thus finding suitable belay stances, but after the traverse of the first pitch, Piers took the reigns to continue diagonally up the buttress blinding following a natural diagonal break until the route’s final crux pitch reveals itself. Upon reaching the third belay, Piers belayed Isaac then Alex, with (surprise surprise) Jonty - Alex’s friend – in tow, who complained about a slow-moving but thoroughly psyched party (Jake and George) that had hampered their earlier progress on The Runnel. After a brief catchup, and with dying light and temperatures dropping, Isaac led the stunning final pitch, containing the bridging-move-filled chimney, all the way to the plateau and the awaiting groups above. Piers and Alex followed on, chasing the sound of the faint cheers and heckles of those above as they reveled in the successes of the day. Once regrouped at the top of the plateau, the group made their way to the Chais ridge under the light of a bright moonrise, and back to the car park to get ready for the long trip back to London the next morning.\nTour Review With technical mixed climbing completed by everyone in the group, one could argue that it was a success, given the relatively slim chances of having good conditions during a trip so early in the winter season. Typically, during late December and early January, climbing is possible, but the quality can vary due to the temperature being too high for sustained freeze-thaw cycles, which leads to the build- up of ice and deep snow, both on the buttresses and faces. Without these cycles, when new snow falls, it lingers in its powdery state before melting completely, which doesn’t provide the best conditions and easily makes climbing 1-2 grades harder due to the lack of extra pick and crampon placements which are provided by the bonding ice, thus also making other placements feel insecure and requiring greater balance and technique.\nThe novices amongst the group received in-depth instruction and guidance into Scottish winter climbing, which should provide a valuable base for future winter tours and experience that can be used for future expeditions to The Alps and Alaska, however, limited opportunities to further develop these skills on lead will stunt progress. More advanced members of the group completed their objective – to have fun – with many agreeing that it was one of their better winter trips in recent memory.\nClosing Remarks and Future Plans Overall, the success of the tour is best highlighted by the group’s desire to return to the northern corries in the future, with all members either intending to return for the tour next year or return later in the season for more winter climbing in better conditions! ICMC wholeheartedly wishes to return to the northern Cairngorms for another winter tour in 2022/23 and train the next generation of Imperial students in the niche skills used in Scottish winter mountaineering.\n","date":"2021-12-28T00:00:00Z","image":"YAYAYA/YAYAYA/YAYAYA/p/winter-tour-2021/images/0_hu_22592c28b6b68ccb.jpg","permalink":"YAYAYA/p/winter-tour-2021/","title":"Winter Tour 2021"},{"content":"The full Expedition report can be found here: Expedition report\nExpedition members Tristan Dell James Foote ","date":"2021-06-30T00:00:00Z","image":"YAYAYA/YAYAYA/YAYAYA/p/dolomites-2021/cover_hu_4b1fb9de0057cb25.png","permalink":"YAYAYA/p/dolomites-2021/","title":"Dolomites 2021"},{"content":"By Oliver Tippett\nBackground History Fontainebleau (Font) was used to practice the skills necessary for alpinism since the 1870s, but since the 1930s it has solidly established itself as one of the premier bouldering destinations in the world. Everywhere you look there is something to climb, with soft sandy landings and old shoeless Frenchmen offering advice on technique. The boulders in Font are made of soft sandstone, which often forms very rounded, chest shaving tops to boulders that can make even the most elegant of climbers look like a beached whale. It is also world famous for its ridiculously technical and sandbagged slabs that are incredibly useful for popping an overinflated ego. It is also home to classic boulders of every grade, from La Marie Rose (f6a+), to Carnage (f7b+) and Rainbow Rocket (f8a). Moreover, every sector in Font will have a couple of circuits. These comprise of about 50 easier problems and the aim is to complete all of them.\nFontainebleau was made famous to us by the movie The Real Thing , a 1996 classic full of techno and hard climbing featuring Jerry Moffatt and Ben Moon. In this they train on the gritstone boulders of Derbyshire and then come over to teach the French how to climb on their own rock. Spurred on by our club trips to the Peak, we were determined to make the journey to Font to do the same!\nObjectives After more than a year of COVID and lockdowns, our main objective was to be able to travel abroad safely and responsibly. We all made sure to read up on the current guidelines about international travel before setting off and adhered to all necessary testing. It was unfortunate that the associated costs with extra testing in France and on return to the UK made the trip prohibitively expensive for many potential attendees. This limited our numbers to a small group of 8, but this served to strengthen the relationships made within the group.\nWe also aimed to enjoy ourselves whilst staying safe as well as to sample some of the French culture and language. This was done with great aplomb at the Lidl bakery section. We all had our own climbing objectives for the trip, which are detailed below.\nThe Team Name Role Degree Year Aim Olly Tippett Tour Leader Mech Eng 4th Do Rainbow Rocket, some circuits and slabs Jake Lewis Tour Organiser Aero 4th Climb a f7a, 100 boulder problems Miguel \u0026ldquo;One Move f7a\u0026rdquo; Boland One Move f7a Eliminate Fetishist One Move f7a training f7a Climb a one move f7a eliminate Emyr Williams The Slab Hero Aero 4th Get back into climbing post COVID and do a full circuit.

Olly drove his van with a few pads to the campsite and set up in the early afternoon. He was then joined by Miguel, Jake, James, and Emyr who had driven a separate car from England. They all set up the brand-new tent and were excited by its lack of mould and holes. A tarp was set up from the van to some trees to construct a sitting area for when it rained. They had just missed the season for the campsite swimming pool being open, so had to settle for the occasional shower with poor water pressure. Eager to get climbing, the early to arrive people ventured out to Gorge aux Chats, the local crag to the campsite. There they acquainted themselves with the local rock and attempted the softest problem in Font, Dallain (f6c). It was a one move dyno that most people did to make them feel better about themselves after getting completely shut down by a desperate f3+ slab.\nAfter a brief tickle of the rocks, Olly had to leave to pick up Ben and George from the train station. By the time this was done it was getting dark, so everyone met back at the campsite. The team cooked chilli sin carne and ate it very quickly. The evening concluded with everyone sipping on cheap tiny French beers, when suddenly the question arose, where was Chorley?\nDay 2 (20/9/21) That night, everyone could hear the sound of rain on the tent, signalling a mandatory rest day. Sandstone is very fragile when wet, so it is very bad form to try to climb it after rain. This meant that they decided to walk the 25 mounds circuit of the forest. It was about 13 miles and took in 25 hills with over 1000m of vertical ascent, going through some of the classic climbing locations. Miguel and Emyr decided to run this circuit and did so impressively in under 3 hours. The rest got about halfway before questioning their motivations but had to carry on as it was the shortest way back. They all arrived back shortly before dark, all grumpy that they had to go for a massive trek rather than climb.\nIn the meantime, Miguel had picked Chorley up from the train station, and everyone was now at the campsite. Chorley had to undergo a Flixbus nightmare. His bus was late on the ferry, meaning that he missed his connection. After being ushered onto a seemingly random coach, he had to check maps on his phone to make sure the bus was in fact destined for Paris. He eventually made it after almost 24 hours of travel. For dinner, Olly made his famous chorizo carbonara, which everyone managed to force down, but spirits were high as the forecast looked good for the next few days.\nDay 3 (21/9/21) The next morning the team headed to Roche aux Sabots , a crag with relatively little forest cover so the rocks got the sun and dried quicker. The aim was to complete either the blue or orange circuit over the course of the day, however for most this changed to climbing whatever looked cool. Most people got to about the 20th problem of the circuit before going to try hard on something else. A group went to try Graviton (f7a). The hard part of this was getting over the very top, which prompted Chorley to try to jump past the top, resulting in a rash over his chest. Meanwhile Miguel was working on a boulder called Legalize This (f7a). This was a one move f7a eliminate from undercuts to the top of the block. Miguel was consistently getting his hand over the top but couldn’t latch the hold. Chorley came over and sent it, fulfilling his aim of climbing f7a on his first day climbing. He then repeated the problem next go to get it on video. Olly also did the problem, first go, in flip flops, proving once again that he is the greatest climber in the club. Olly had also achieved his goal of completing the blue circuit that day, which provided a lot of varied and entertaining boulder problems. The best of these were recommended to the rest of the group. Over the day James had done a few f7a and f7a+s without anyone noticing. At the end of the day, Miguel had to be pulled away from his one move eliminate f7a project as it was getting dark.\nBen cooked coq au van for dinner, which was delicious and contained a good amount of red wine although it could not compete with the Lidl “peach rings” that everyone on the trip had become addicted to by now. Everyone felt thoroughly knackered by the end of the meal and got to sleep very quickly.\nDay 4 (22/9/21) The next day most of the team ventured to F ranchard Isatis , a classic of Font bouldering areas. Chorley and Olly however went to Franchard Sablons Carriers instead in the morning to try their projects. Chorley was trying Sylphide (f7a) whilst Olly attempted Rainbow Rocket (f8a). Both took turns at trying their boulders while the other rested in the hammock. They each touched the top of their dynos, but neither could stick it. After a couple hours of trying, they both gave up and headed to Isatis to meet up with the others. When they got there, they found that the rest had befriended an old pof-riddled Frenchman. He was chastising them about using shoes and crash pads as well as spotting with one hand with a cigarette in to other. He did show us some good problems though, as well as Miguel another eliminate f7a dyno for him to wear his skin more on. Everyone was fairly tired after the previous day of climbing so were taking it easy, although a few people went to try some highball problems, which put hairs on their chests. After a final bit of climbing, they all retreated to the campsite for some well-earned risotto and rest.\nDay 5 (23/9/21) After a brief stop to buy every baguette and pastry at Lidl, the team ventured to La Canche aux Merciers for some more bouldering. This was a particularly nice crag despite the hordes of French urchins school children running around being annoying and the disabled dog that could boulder harder than any of us to get to our food bag and eat our cured meats and cheese. Today’s aim was the same as the others; start trying to do a circuit, then get distracted and try something too hard. Olly, Emyr and Jake did manage to complete their full circuits, whilst James smashed out some more f7a and f7a+s. A multitude of other problems were attempted; a few people tried a f7a+ roof, a few tried some weird crack, and Miguel found another one move f7a eliminate. Ben nearly finished the whole circuit, but got completely shut down by a f3+ slab, which caused most people a lot of frustration. They left the crag late that evening with very sore skin and very hungry. Unfortunately, they had to wait until 11pm for Jake’s underwhelming spaghetti bolognaise to be ready, by which time everyone was full from snacking on too many peach rings and bolognaise flavoured crisps. They didn’t let Jake be in charge of cooking again.\nDay 6 (24/9/21) On their penultimate climbing day, the team awoke to a dense fog. They drove to Bas Cuvier to see if the rock was dry and were greeted by a slightly moist crag. The team did some stretching on the pads while they waited for the rock to dry and realised that they were all very stiff from all the climbing. They then warmed up by throwing a crash pad at each other. By the time they were bored of this the fog had cleared, the sun was out, and the rock was dry. Bas Cuvier was supposed to be the most classic crag in Font, however it was strewn with broken glass, used hypodermic needles, condoms and human excrement. This rather diminished the psych to climb, and the rock was quite polished, however the team tried La Marie Rose (f6a+), which is potentially the most famous boulder in Font. James tried to do Carnage (f7b+) and got close before giving up. Olly tried to do L\u0026rsquo;Hélicoptère (f7a), named for what your legs do when you fall off. He didn’t do it but he also didn’t break anything, so that was a win. Miguel couldn’t find a one move eliminate f7a so was grumpy. George tried Pif-paf (f7a), a route named after a powerful nerve agent cockroach killing spray. He swiftly gave up due to the problem’s proximity to the human turd. Well before it was dark, everone realised that they were absolutely wrecked, so they went back to the campsite via a pizza place for dinner.\nDay 7 (25/9/21) The day began with a trip to the local town to be tested for COVID before travelling back to the UK. After and French lady had aggressively swabbed our noses, we headed to Le Cul de Chien. This was half crag half beach and was probably the best one that the team went to. After a long week with only one rest day at the very start, the team weren’t psyched on trying anything too hard, so aimed for another circuit. This didn’t end up happening for most however, since as normal they were distracted by a different boulder. The team tried some f6a+ mantle, which was another chest scraper. Most people managed this, despite some astounding inflexibility from Jake. A few people also managed to finish their circuits after this, and the team made sure to dog proof their food bag. George tried Le Toit du Cul du Chien (f7a), which looked a bit like (and is named after) the behind of a dog. He got some good pictures of him falling off it.\nMiguel, again unhappy with the lack of one move f7a eliminates, went back to the nearby Roche aux Sabots to try his one move f7a eliminate project. He spent a short while trying before realising that this one move f7a eliminate wasn’t for him. He decided in future to change his style and aim to climb a one move f7a eliminate in the UK on different rock. A few people had meanwhile managed a full circuit, while others lay on the sand trying to grow back their skin that had been eroded over the week. They drove back to the campsite for a final night of curry and tiny French beer, sad at the thought of leaving the next day.\nDay 8 (26/9/21) The next morning they woke up and packed the tent up. After checking out the campsite, Miguel drove his car back to the UK. Olly and George had booked a later ferry before going back in the van, so went to have a final look at Rainbow Rocket , but it was wet after an overnight shower, so they drove back and ate chips in Calais waiting for their ferry. The team made the most of their duty free allowance, George hasn’t been able to walk in a straight line since he got back.\nTour Review We all achieved negative COVID results both in France and on return of the UK, which meant that we had fulfilled our goal of not spreading the virus. We had also had a week of climbing with no injuries or major dramas.\nIn terms of personal climbing objectives, only Chorley managed to reach his goal of climbing f7a, whilst Olly, Jake and Emyr managed to complete at least one full circuit. Jake did manage to climb well over 100 problems and Emyr got back into climbing with style. James ticked a number of hard problems over f7a but failed to do the hardest problem of the trip, so decided to lock himself in a gym and train for 6 years.\nMiguel’s search for a one move f7a eliminate continues. The whole trip ran smoothly, without any real issues. The low number of people meant that logistics were easier and that we could drive around crags. The main negative of the trip was the lack of rest days. The team had 5 climbing days in a row, which really took a toll on their skin and their psych. Next time it would be better to go for a week extra and have more rest days. All in all Font delivered all that we hoped it would, and the club will definitely be back in future years.\nBudget While the initial budget was made for 15 people to take three cars from the UK, the costs associated with being tested both in France (€20 each) and in the UK (~£50 each) made the trip more expensive per person than anticipated. This was offset by the fact that only 8 people came as opposed to the 15 budgeted for. Overall, the expenditure on travel was £1665,13, which included getting a car and a van, as well as the other members who couldn’t fit in these, to and from Fontainebleau. The IC Trust gave us £670.50 of funding, which was slightly less than the 40% of travel expenditure we ended up having (£695.95). Overall, the trip could have been much cheaper had we not had to spend so much on testing and had we all gone to and from London together, however space in the car was a major constraint. Added to this, George came from Croatia and Ben from Rome, and Ben left a day early, adding to the expenses.\nExpenditure Value Campsite £488 Food £253.33 Ferries £380.73 Tolls £91.27 Fuel £449.15 COVID testing £520 Busses £113.99 Trains £183.99 Total £2480.46 Conclusion and Future Plans The tour was a fun trip abroad for everyone, and we will definitely be back to Font in future. All attendees not in their final year of study expressed interest in going on and potentially running future tours, and the experience and competence of outdoor boulderers in the club has been markedly improved. Miguel is still looking for a one move f7a eliminate, if you know of one please contact him at: miguel@1movef7aeliminate.com. Thanks.\n","date":"2021-01-02T00:00:00Z","image":"YAYAYA/YAYAYA/YAYAYA/p/summer-tour-2021/images/cover_hu_cbb2a352a0a50ba4.png","permalink":"YAYAYA/p/summer-tour-2021/","title":"Summer Tour 2021"},{"content":"After three consecutive weekends of crap weather and not much outdoor climbing, the forecast finally looked half decent for a trip so with a minibus of 12 top class climbers and Jake, we headed to the Peaks. With Ben on a rogue midterm holiday to Portugal, the command of the trip fell jointly to Ferdie and Ciaran, who are both vying to replace him in the coming AGM. A box of old space wine was found in stores which, along with the poor forecast for Saturday, led to a rather inebriated minibus. I disgraced myself on the bus in ways not suitable for a PG trip report such as this, whilst Fresher George’s nickname was permanently changed to Corridor George after he revisited some of his dinner in the Nelson Arms’ corridor.\nOnce all the bags were in the Pub, Jake and I hatched a secret plan to sneak off to the nearby Black Rocks for some midnight bouldering. For some reason I was convinced it would be dry, despite the pouring rain that had only just stopped. My disappointment in finding the rock dripping was quelled by the sights of some mega-classic climbs. The combination of being moodily lit from below by headtorches and the excessive amount of port that had been consumed made Gaia (E8 6c) look unreasonably intimidating. By now, everyone else had joined us, and Anna agreed to try leading it next year if she is VP. We all returned to the pub with immense psych for Saturday.\nThe boozy bus took its toll on everyone come the morning. This was alleviated by a pancake breakfast. Miguel’s French ancestors would be turning in their graves at his scrambled crêpes, however Anna stepped up and corrected the pancakes, which were then perfected by myself by topping it with golden syrup and sugar. My sugar free lent was not going well. The destination for the day was Stanage (which I have run out of funny ways to say is really good). Expecting a soggy hike, we were all surprised to see the crag was mostly dry. Luckily it was so cold that the rain throughout the day froze to hail before hitting the ground, keeping the rock dry, and the wind up the crag prevented most of the rain from even landing. This wind did cause a few false starts with Jake and Ciaran sensibly backing off routes when the hail started.\nDespite the hail Corridor George soldiered on and led his first ever trad route, Heaven Crac (VDiff), perhaps cementing his claim to the Keenest Fresher award? Spurred on, Ciaran led the hilarious BAWs Crawl (HVS 5a), which involves inserting yourself into the crag. Psych for trad was low, so most people bouldered for the rest of the day. Dom had the most successful day, sending The Green Traverse (f7a) and Deliverance (f7b+), earning himself the alias: ‘The Dominator’. He proceeded to tell everyone that he had done Deliverance several times, giving credence to the intrinsic hatred for boulderers present in all sentient life. A lack of height proved troublesome for Anna on Thin Slab (f6B) when she couldn’t reach the top from the last existent footholds. Faced with a dyno from no positive hands and after 5 minutes of contemplation, she finally went for it, and ended up in A\u0026amp;E with a very swollen ankle. This marked the end of the day’s climbing, after which we returned to the pub all completely knackered.\nA decent dinner and an early night were followed by an early morning and significantly worse than decent breakfast. That being said, the fact that no one ate it allowed us to get on the bus and to the crag quicker. With a clear forecast, we ventured to Froggatt for a day of new milestones. Jake managed to lead Tody’s Wall (HVS 5a) after a great deal of dithering before, during and after the route. This, despite being soft as shit, was his first proper HVS. Izzy meanwhile lead her first HS (Sunset Crack) and Corridor George did the very popular Heather Wall (HVD 3c). It was on this day that Miguel realised that sport climbing is a contrived European exercise in imperfection, and learned to embrace the art of trad, leading a HS offwidth with few enough big cams to make it slightly spicy (probably a Nando’s Lemon and Herb).\nCiaran and I both did Chequers Buttress (HVS 5a), a picturesque route that can be seen on my Instagram (@oliver_tippett (Neil Gresham follows me)), and Sunset Slab (HVS 4b). On the latter we both placed pointless low gear and led the route, even though it is effectively a solo because safety always comes first on ICMC trips. The boulderers spent the day taking pictures of themselves pulling onto impressive looking blocs that they couldn’t get anywhere near sending. This was to be expected as boulderers all love themselves far too much. They did all get some real bouldering done as well apparently.\nAfter a full-on weekend of climbing came the minibus back to London, via the illustrious Pizzeria Loughborough. This time it was Filip’s turn to attempt the third ascent of the double meat junction. His attempt was valiant, yet ultimately ended in defeat after his pizza was pried from his hands for requesting a chunder bucket. No doubt he would have carried on eating until either great success, or great failure. He has since said we will be back to finish what he started, next time with half a bottle of vodka to help. All in all this was a trip that bodes well for next year in the ICMC and proves that we really don’t need Ben (you can stay in Portugal).\n","date":"2020-03-01T00:00:00Z","image":"YAYAYA/YAYAYA/YAYAYA/p/peaks-trip-report-march-2020/cover_hu_dbad443356f1d50a.jpg","permalink":"YAYAYA/p/peaks-trip-report-march-2020/","title":"Peaks Trip Report March 2020"},{"content":" The first ICMC trip of the decade was to the hallowed gritstone crags of the peak district, and it was mega. Hopes were low when we arrived at The Nelson Arms on Friday evening, with drizzle making any climbing over the weekend look unlikely. Nevertheless, Ed managed to convince Ben to get everyone up before the sun had even risen in hope of getting a full day of climbing. Such a move is unprecedented in recent ICMC history, and perhaps marks the start of a new era of climbing hard (and possibly even eating lard?). Over the course of the previous week I had also been pestering Ben to take us to Millstone, an old gritstone quarry famous for its cracks and arêtes. Ben didn’t need much convincing, fresh from tearing up the Westway crack every Wednesday.\nOn arriving at Millstone, we were surprised to find it relatively dry. We were even more surprised to find an almost new big purple Black Diamond Camalot overcammed halfway up a VS offwidth. Ciaran was fastest to set up an abseil onto it and got to work trying to get it out. It took him almost 2 hours to get it, breaking a nut key in the process, but at last he claimed it. Whilst was doing this, everyone else got climbing. Mike Chan, who had driven down from Edinburgh the night before, banished any illusion of fatigue by warming up on Regent’s Street (E2 5c). At the same time Jake, Stu, Martha and I were shamefully doing some bouldering. Technical Master (f6b+) went down for Ciaran, Anna, Mike and me over the course of the day. After this the real climbing began, sort of. Jake immediately got shut down by the “polished and shit” classic Embankment 1 (VS 4c), barely making it off the ground. I then dogged my way up Embankment 3 (E1 5b) and Anna also dogged up the much easier Embankment 4 (E1 5b). Ben had a good attempt of seconding up Embankment 3, before struggling to get his sausage fingers into the pin scars. Apparently ICMC doesn’t do well on cracks without the ice axes. Although no one could feel their hands due to the cold, somehow the pain of finger jamming could still be felt as much as, if not more than usual.\nOur fortunes turned after Lunch however, with Ciaran and Ed leading the super classic Great North Road (HVS 5a), Anna managing to do Embankment 3, and Ed and Ben teaching trad to the less experienced people by setting up practice leads on top rope. Mike produced one of the scarier leads of the trip. When he latched the top of Tea for Two (E4 6a), he was facing a monster fall of at least 10m if he failed to negotiate the crux. Ben and Jake were looking on seemingly more scared than Mike.\nMartha had a nice nap on a bouldering pad, and might have put her shoes on once, but no one saw. It was Burn’s night that evening, so we had an authentic Scottish meal of haggis, neaps and taties. Ciaran even addressed the haggis before we ate it.\nThe second day was the antithesis of the first. We knew it would piss with rain most of the day, and somehow Anna managed to convince Ben to take us to the half falling apart, half underwater, 100% nails sport crag called Rubicon. I thought it sacrilegious to go to a limestone crag whilst in the peaks, and my fears were realised when we saw that most of the climbs had deep pits of mud underneath them. No pit of mud was as deep as the one underneath Rubicon (F7a), the classic of the crag. Hanging belays just above the ground were discussed as options to prevent climbing shoes being covered in mud, but eventually a rope bag was sacrificed. Anna was the first to attempt it, easily negotiating the 4m to the first bolt above the safety net of the mud, however couldn’t get the clean lead due to reachy moves on damp holds. Ed, Martha and Stu all had similar experiences on it, but all got to the top. The others who were inspired enough to put their shoes on by the choss worked on a f6b+ boulder, which was done by Anna, Ben and Jake. Ciaran spent all his energy working it out, but his heavy day of pulling on the stuck cam yesterday left him unable to get it before a wet streak reached the crucial holds.\nFor everyone else it was a day of less than productive activities. That being said two interesting games did come out of it. Firstly, dynamic nut placements were practiced by Ciaran and me, with Jake’s nuts. After about 10 minutes of jumping and at full stretch swinging the nut at the placement, we had got it in and we weren’t going to get it out again, much to Jake’s annoyance.\nThe second game will go down as a classic of ICMC history; ‘Danger Jug’. It was said that the crag wasn’t that bad because ‘you could take home all your favourite holds with you’. This was true for a particularly loose jug low in a cave under Rubicon. We all took turns to do pull ups off the jug, occasionally giving it a wobble or adding an extra person’s weight, until it came off. On the final attempts Ben even wore a helmet over his face to stop it breaking his nose if it came off. The jug has since gone to where all good rock should go; hung up in stores for people to train on for years to come.\nDespite all this the greatest achievement happened on the way home, with Jake managing to finish two meat junctions on his first attempt. Such a feat calls into question the possibility of the audacious triple meat junction. For sure this is one of the last great problems of life, and would bring worldwide attention to that most famous Loughborough institution.\n","date":"2020-01-24T00:00:00Z","image":"YAYAYA/YAYAYA/YAYAYA/p/peaks-trip-report-jan-2020/cover_hu_8d0972ac83c02ee4.jpg","permalink":"YAYAYA/p/peaks-trip-report-jan-2020/","title":"Peaks Trip Report Jan 2020"},{"content":"Expedition report\nTeam members Melanie Flury Geraint Northwood-Smith Tristan Dell Bailey Lathrop Maxine Dillon ","date":"2019-07-01T00:00:00Z","permalink":"YAYAYA/p/china-expedition-2019/","title":"China Expedition 2019"},{"content":"Member Attendees Richard Metcalfe, Stuart McClune, Alex Smith, Charlotte Krishek, Kuran Pahwa, Hannah Nevill, Shan Pandya, Keeran Sivalingam, Nick Koukoulekidis, Mertcan Sevgi, Sean Barret, Suviti Chari.\nAims and objectives To pull hard on the amazing rock climbs in the valleys surrounding Chulilla; a very popular, new climbing area in southern Spain. Many of the members had never climbed outdoors before so another aim was to teach them how to safely operate ropes and deal with the situations that arise from climbing outdoors.\nDay 1 After a crazily early start (or all-nighter in the case of the members returning from the peak district trip) to catch the 7:30 flight to Valencia, the group managed to pull together enough psych to go and climb on the roadside crags in Chulilla. This gave the perfect taste of the week ahead, lovely limestone climbs, well bolted routes, and lots of laughter. A trip to the shops for cheap Spanish wine was undertaken. Food was also found, and the group enjoyed a warm evening inside before heading to bed early.\nSuvi pulling hard\nDay 2 After a breakfast of porridge (described as the most meagre portion of porridge ever by one member) the group headed to the crag. A nice morning in the shade was had, teaching people all of the key safety aspects of route cleaning and other such fun. Alex and Richard went off to climb a simple multipitch in the afternoon whilst the rest of the group climbed some more on the shorter walls before enjoying the cooling river and a slackline session. Alex and Richard were having way more fun as they had decided abseiling was lame, and they would walk off the top of their route. 3 hours later and an abseil through a bramble bush they get back onto the path, dehydrated and knackered. An enjoyable meal and bonding session was had in the evening.\nRichard and Alex halfway up Orgasmatrón\nDay 3 REST DayYYYY. The group headed to a different sector and had a nice morning of easy climbing to cure their hangovers. Lunch was had at an incredible swimming area with beautiful limestone caves hiding behind the waterfalls. The group then decided clothes were lame and posed for a centre fold picture. Some preceded to stay naked for a lot longer than was necessary. Supplies were gathered for another night and the group had an incredible BBQ before building a fire and spending the evening outside.\nRichard on the route Eco-Dildo\nDay 4 A day jam packed with crushing, single and multi-pitch climbing along with some idiocy from the future president. Everyone was feeling refreshed and full of psych. Two groups headed off to try some multi pitch early in the morning. Richard and Hannah flew up their route whilst Charlotte and Shan dawdled up theirs. Everyone else climbed at a new crag, got very hot and then left in search of food. The group reassembled for lunch and then Alex, Stuart and Richard headed off to try something hard in the Sex-Shop sector. The aptly named Eco-Dildo was the route of choice and the three guys stayed late trying for the send. Richard was a moron and didn’t take any quickdraws with him so downclimbed the crux on his flash attempt before coming down screaming. Stuart then crushed and flashed a grade he’d never climbed before (what a wad). Alex was weak. Everyone reconvened at the house for a delicious Bolognese.\nIncredible view up the Chulilla Gorge\nDay 5 It was the last day of climbing for the group; people were sad and exhausted. This didn’t stop them though. Stuart crushed again; flashing another 7a. Everyone pulled hard on routes and could be proud of what they achieved across the week. An early dinner of stir fry was had before another fire and more wine was enjoyed. Some youths were staying next door and at 4am Mert went full dad mode and told them to shut off the music. He also made the group sandwiches, which were incredible and well needed at the airport the following morning.\nAn enjoyable evening for all\nDay 6 Glassy eyed and a bit broken the group arose at 6am to travel home.

We hope that these skills will allow members to both plan their own winter trips and keep winter skills active in the club.\nThis is also a great base for building future mountaineering and alpine skills that would be great to further instil within the club.\nObjectives For new members to gain key winter skills, including avalanche safety, route planning, equipment choice, self-arrest, movement skills and pick placement. Members with more experience should begin to practice leading winter routes independently to cement the skills they developed in previous years. Improve general summer mountaineering skills, including navigation and route planning, on the lower hills or munros (weather permitting). Introduce the concept of dry tooling to improve pick and crampon placement. Overall, we felt we achieved the aims of the tour. Charlotte, Stuart, Sonny and Rowan were instructed on winter skills for two days with a guide that gave them essential winter skills and more! Lizzie used the second day of the course to refresh her existing winter skills. Jen and Alex honed their winter skills from last year by leading their first winter route. Cat and Will practiced moving together quickly over easier ground. Munro bagging on Bynack More allowed us to practice our navigation skills and a day in Newtyle Quarry introduced the group to dry tooling.\nFinancial overview Income Value Member Income £1593 ICU Funding 311.93 Total 1904.93 Expenditure Value Vehicle hire £509 Fuel £313.26 Accomodation £375 Linen £72 Food £235.46 Guide hire £400 Total £1904.72 Tour log Day 1\nAn early start for everyone on the first day of the winter break as we met at the Union at 6am! With the back of the bus piled with climbing gear and sleepy climbers, we started our 550-mile journey to the Cairngorms. Jen and Alex heroically drove the 10-hour journey between them. Stopping only for a tour of the UKs service stations and to stock up on food for the week, we made good time and arrived at a little cottage in Nethy Bridge – our home for the next week.\nDay 2\nDespite the early start the previous day, we were keen to make the most of the snow! Leaving the new members for an extended sleep before meeting their guide, Jen, Alex, Cat and Will set off to Coire an t-Sneachda to start our walk in at first light. Despite nearly walking into the wrong coire, we made a speedy approach to the base of our routes. Cat and Will started up Spiral Gully (II), but due to driving rain and the first pitch comprising of a pile of slush, backed off and made their way back to wring out their clothes and drink hot chocolate. Jen and Alex made their way slowly but surely up the Runnel (II). A classic winter route that usually does not involve an extensive rocky chimney pitch, but lack of good snow upped the challenge! A fantastic first winter route for both Jen and Alex!\nMeanwhile, the rest of the group met up with their guide who talked them through the basics before taking them out for some practice in the northern coires. Soon the group were practicing cutting steps, ice axe arrests and winter navigation.\nRowan, Stuart, Sonny, Charlotte and Kev demonstrating some well-cut steps!\nAfter a cold day for everyone, we headed back to the house for some well-deserved showers and dinner!\nDay 3\nAfter swinging by Aviemore train station to pick up Lizzie, we headed back to Sneachda. Most of the group continuing with their guide to consolidate a few more winter skills and have a go at putting them in to practice. Ending their skills course with a hidden gem – an unmelted ice pitch!\nCharlotee cruising up the ice.\nJen, Alex, Cat and Will made the most of the clear day and beautiful weather by tackling Ficalli Ridge. Not only could we practice moving together, but it offered incredibly views of Coire an Snechda and lochan!\nWill, Jen, Cat and Alex at the start of Ficalli Ridge. Alex falling down one of many holes.\nDay 4\nAfter two days of (somewhat) winter conditions, our luck run out. The weather turned warm and rainy with strong winds, so we headed for the coast in search of dry rock and milder weather! After scouring UKC we came across a crag full of promise! Sea cliff trad in an idyllic location, what could go wrong? Unfortunately, when we arrived at the crag we began to realise why it didn’t receive much traffic! Covered in a thick layer of yellow lichen and dripping wet despite the sun, even the boldest of us didn’t fancy the abseil down to the sea.\nLooking down at the yellow, lichenous rocks.\nDetermined not to waste the day (or the long drive), we headed back to the bus and continued another 20 minutes down the coast to a crag we had enjoyed the previous year. After a brief detour to a ruined castle and navigating around the collapsing coastal path, we arrived at a secluded rocky outcrop. A little wet and not the biggest of crags, but it packed in some good routes.\nStuart cruised up a slabby Bladder Wrack (S 4b), utilising probably the most unnecessary heel hook ever used in ICMC. Lizzy led her first HS, Fisherman’s Tail, and demonstrated excellent trad face. Charlotte battled her way up the soggy Poacher (VS 4 b), learning that gear can be your friend – especially when pumped!\nStuart and the Unnecessary Heel Hook.\nLizzy with a fine example of trad face.\nCharlotte and the Inescapable Pump._\nDay 5\nWith no sign of winter returning, the group looked for another way to practice their axe placement and show off those lock offs – dry tooling at Newtyle Quarry!\nAlex crushing at Newtyle.\nJen, Will and Cat opted for a walk in the nearby forests, taking in the gorgeous local scenery. Finishing up early, they made a start on a full roast dinner with all the trimmings for that night’s dinner.\nDay 6\nWe sadly had to say goodbye to Sonny and popped him on an early morning train home. To make the most of the early start, we decided to take everyone on a long walk. Still in darkness we left the minibus at Glenmore Lodge and started the climb up to Bynack More (1090m). We were treated to beautiful views of sunrise over the Cairngorms as we went.\nSunrise on the approach to Bynack More.\nHaving reached the summit in excellent time, we decided to continue the day taking in A’Choinneach (1017m) and Cairn Gorm (1245m) itself. We gratefully stopped in the warmth of the café for hot chocolate and cake before descending back to the minibus. Unfortunately, some bridges marked on the map were distinctly absent and an impromptu river crossing left everyone with soggy shoes! We headed home to start dinner and find somewhere to dry out eight pairs of shoes!\nCrisp and clear: A beautiful winter’s day walking.\nDay 7\nFor our last full day in the Cairngorms, we were determined to try and pack in some climbing. We set off to a hidden gem, suggested by Jen, Huntly’s Cave. Our hearts sank as we drove closer, the rock was looking less than dry. In time old ICMC tradition, we filed out the bus to touch the wet rock. It turns out we weren’t entirely right. It wasn’t just wet. It was covered in a fine layer of frost. While most of us were content to gaze at the incredible assortment of blocky, overhung routes and dream of summer, Charlotte is never one to back down from a challenge. She geared up and started up an impressively damp and slimy route. We watched, shouted encouragements and ate popcorn while she made her way up. Jen followed and confirmed it was a heinously slippery route. Not encourage by this review, we made an executive decision to retreat to a quaint tea shop.\nThat evening, the house was filled with activity as everybody worked on their Secret Santa present and Jen cooked her eagerly awaited ‘Nutty Bol’. Dinner was a treat, copious amounts of mulled wine was drunk and a fabulous array of homemade gifts were swapped. Altogether not a bad way to end a trip!\nSecret Santa! Alex trying on his new light-weight harness.\nCharlotte’s new state of theart gear placement simulator.\nLizzie showing off her own mini-mountain range.\nDay 8\nWe got up early to do a final sweep of the house and started on our long journey back. Jen and Alex, our absolute superstars, drove us back to London. The rest of the group slept the majority of the journey back, dreaming that Christmas would bring some better winter conditions!\nUseful Information Guide\nCoordinated through Cairngorm Adventure Guides.

A new plan to visit the Virjerab glacier to the east of Shimshal and make an attempt on the unclimbed peak of Khurdopin Sar also fell through after access the glacier was found to be impossible. They eventually headed north to Boesam Pass with the aim of attempting unclimbed peaks below 6500m. The expedition was kindly supported by the Mount Everest Foundation, the Chris Walker Memorial Trust and Expedition Foods. It also received financial support from Imperial College London Exploration Board. This report gives a detailed account of the expedition from planning through to the seven attempts made on peaks from Boesam Pass during the 4 weeks spent in the area.\nExpedition Members Tim Seers (25) is a junior Doctor now living in Manchester having recently graduated from Imperial College London. He had previously spent three seasons climbing in the European Alps in the summer climbing up to about D+. He has also climbed in Scotland for the last 4 winters up to V, 5 as well as rock climbing throughout the UK and throughout Europe up to HVS. Tim led the expedition and also acted as expedition medic.\nJames Lawson (27) has recently graduated with a PhD from Imperial College London and is now a postdoctoral research assistant living in London working on power electronics for various applications. James has spent four summers and some time over the last winter in the European Alps climbing up to TD+. He has also climbed throughout the UK up to E1 and in Scotland in the winter up to IV,5. He has recently enjoyed running in several UK mountain marathons with Tim.\nWill Smith (24) is a Control Systems Engineer working at a national laboratory near Liverpool. Will has spent 4 summers in the French Alps climbing up to D-, as well as a number of years in Scotland in winter up to IV 4 and throughout UK and Europe climbing up to E1. He is now a member of Liverpool University Mountaineering Club. All three members of the team met while studying at Imperial College London and helped to run Imperial College Mountaineering Club.\nBackground on Boesam Pass Boesam Pass lies just to the north of Shimshal in the Karakorum. It is visited by herdsmen and occasional trekkers, both foreign and domestic, but has rarely been visited by climbing parties. Although Information is scarce on other expeditions we are aware that Pir Peak was summited in the winter of 1999 by the Pakistan Alpine Club, Abdullah Bei and Francois Carrel made presumed first accents of peaks immediately North West and north east of the pass in 2005 and in 2011 Mirza Ali and his sister Samina Baig summited Koh-E-Brobar.\nThe pass is easy to access, taking two days to walk up from Shimshal with a convenient hut located at the halfway point. A basecamp can be made on a fairly flat pasture just on the southern side of the pass with plentiful running water. We found that the best maps covering the area were the Soviet Military Maps Handily we found it was possible to download these onto our phone with an app that included GPS location (Soviet Military Maps Pro). The location of our basecamp and the summits we attempted for reference is shown below. The Swiss Alpine Club map, although popular in the region, lacked sufficient detail for climbing.\nRoutes Attempted Below is a list of the 7 routes we attempted and pictures. In total we believe we made 5 first ascents. All heights and locations were taken with a GPS unless stated otherwise. We had good weather for all of our attempts. However, snow conditions were in general less favourable. We found a hard crust with deep poorly consolidated snow underneath on every route which made for slow progress at times. We named two peaks that we summited after Imtiaz and Arman, our local guide and cook respectively who were a huge asset to the trip.\nFig 1. A map showing the locations of the summits attempted as well as basecamps and bivouacs. G shows Koh-E-Brobar which we did not summit, F shows Unnamed peak 3 which we also failed to summit. Shimshal lies to the south.\nA – Unnamed Peak 1 at 36.53440°N, 75.36591°E, 5700m, on the East of Boesam Pass. Attempted the south face taking the shoulder above a rocky outcrop. Presumed first ascent by Tim Seers, James Lawson and Will Smith. Climbed in a single push in an alpine style. Summited at 0530 on 8th June 2017 in clear calm conditions. Wind slab at the summit, and a short icy section above the shoulder. Around 500m ascent over about 1.5km average angle 35°, around 45° for short sections near shoulder. Grade PD.\nFig 2. Successful attempt up Unnamed Peak 1 by route shown in red. (A) marks the summit.\nB – Imtiaz Sar at 36.56241°N 75.31744°E, 5930m on the West of Boesam Pass Initially attempted via the ridge at the back of the glacial basin on 9th June 2017 but turned back due to a heavily corniced ridge line, a second attempt on the 18th June 2017 proved more fruitful through the rocks at foot of a long ridge line. Summited at 0545 by Tim Seers, Will Smith and James Lawson having started at 0130 from a camp on the glacier at 5200m (shown in the image below at the intersection of the red and green lines). Route is around 2.5km in length with just under 800m ascent, most of which is in the first half in a gully through the rocks and the first section of the ridge. Up to 55° in sections, with ice in the gully. We had poor conditions on the summit ridge with deep powdery snow under a hard thin crust. Climbed in a single push in an alpine style, grade AD.\nFig 3. An unsuccessful attempt at Imtiaz Sar shown in red and the successful route shown in green. The same colours are used in the map in Fig 1. (B) marks the summit.\ncontent/post/2017/BoesamExped2017/figures/ C – Koh-e-Brobar at 36.34921°N 75.241121°E, 6008m on the North of Boesam Pass On the 13th June 2017 Tim Seers, James Lawson and Will Smith attempted the summit by the ~3km ridge to the east, a different line to that of Mirza Ali in 2011. We retreated South at the shoulder where Mirza and Samina had made a camp due to very poor snow conditions at 0745 having set off at 0130. The ridge itself was excellent with massive beautiful cornices to negotiate and some rocky pillars in its mid-section. We summited the unnamed subsidiary peak in the middle at 36.55019°N 75.40026°E 5625m, and there is no record of any other parties attempting this line. Grade PD.\nFig 4. An unsuccessful attempt on Koh-E-Brobar (G) took in the peak at (C).\nD – Unnamed peak 2 at 36.53891°N 75.34747°E height 5503m Attempted by the North West face by Tim Seers, James Lawson, and Will Smith on the 17th June 2017. We had good conditions at the start of the route which quickly deteriorated near the top of the face, leaving us wading through waist deep snow. Setting off in the dark at 0100 in the hope of colder temperatures we approached the crumbling pile of choss that was the summit at 0530 and, after making an initial attempt turned back about 3m from the summit proper. Climbed in an alpine style in a single push, in places 50°, the route is approximately 600m in length. We descended by the gully slightly to the south. Grade AD.\nFig 5. Unnamed peak 2 is shown at (D). The successful route is shown in red.\nE – Arman Sar at 36.57321°N 75.32016°E 5970m Attempted by the prominent eastern ridge by Tim Seers, Will Smith and James Lawson on the 24th June 2017. Setting out at 0030 after a period of slightly warmer weather and wet snow we found a hard crust on the snow between the rocks taking us from the glacier to the ridge proper. After negotiating a steep icy section to make the ridge we passed a series of rocky pinnacles and then continued along the ridge to the ~55° slope at its end. We broke through the first cornice, carried on along a narrow ridge to the second higher peak and then summited at 0730. We descended by the same route, dropping off early to the North having set off a number of avalanches on our way down. Climbed in a single push in an alpine style, approx. 2km, grade AD.\nF – Unnamed peak 3 at 36.34515°N 75.19089°E circa 6000m Attempted by the Eastern ridge from the south facing slope by Tim Seers and Will Smith on the 25th June 2017. We moved a camp slightly closer to the start of the route and set off at 1230 in the hope of better conditions. Having quickly made a high point of 5750m by 0230 we turned around due to terrible barely frozen snow. A shame as the ridge looks awesome and the peak is fairly prominent.\nFig 6. Arman Sar is marked with (E) on the left, while Unnamed Peak 3 is shown on the right at (F), estimated to be just over 6000m.\nExpedition Log 29th May\nLeft Acton and headed to Gatwick where we caught a plane to Islamabad.\n30th May\nArrived safely in Islamabad and met Ibrar, our representative from ATP. Spent a night in Islamabad and checked out the excellent restaurant next to the hotel called Kabul; worth a visit.\n31st May\nFlew to Gilgit then drove immediately to Karimabad where we met Amin, our next ATP rep, and Arman, our cook. After picking up our things from the bus they had travelled on from Islamabad we visited Baltit Fort and Amin kindly invited us to his home for lunch. Arman went shopping for supplies and we spent the evening going over what we would take and eat.\n1st June\nDrove north to Shimshal after hiring Jeeps, Will felt pretty ill. Arrived in Shimshal to meet Imtiaz, our guide for the remainder of the trip. We were told that the Khurdopin glacier had moved and that access to the Virjerab was impossible. Tim and James went with Imtiaz and a porter to investigate.\n2nd June\nTim and James return from their unsuccessful attempt to find a way through the Khurdopin Glacier, and after some deliberation and discussion with local guides we make the decision to head north to Boesam Pass and attempt peaks there. Luckily we had maps which covered this area although we had no pictures of peaks and nobody could give us information on what if anything had been attempted before. It seemed like the most sensible option, so we packed everything up and arranged for porters to arrive in the morning. Porters were paid approximately £35 each for carrying 20kg to our basecamp.\nFor notes on the movement of the Khurdopin glacier see Appendix A\n3rd June\nStage 1. 30 porters and 3 donkeys met us in the morning. We walked up the valley from Shimshal and stopped at Samina Beig’s hut next to the football pitch. ~5 hours\n4th June\nStage 2. Walked up further up the valley for another 4 hours and stopped for lunch at a shepherd’s hut. It turned out the porters had left all of their sleeping equipment at the previous camp, possibly due to a miscommunication, it wasn’t that clear. While some of them went back to get everything Tim and James went on to scout out a location for the basecamp.\n5th June\nSet up our basecamp at 36.53042N 75.33411E on a plateau just south west of the pass itself.\n6th June\nTim, Will and James carried up a tent, ropes, food and equipment to a camp between the lakes on Boesam Pass at 36.5429N 75.34270E. Weather was terrible with very little visibility; the tent almost blows away as we were putting it up!\n7th June\nThe next morning the weather had cleared slightly and we headed out across the pass with binoculars to scout out potential objectives and get our bearings. We identified a peak that we presumed to be unclimbed to the south of the pass, eyed up a potential line and headed to bed.\n8th June\nWe woke up to a crystal clear morning; the snow had frozen fairly well. After reaching a rocky outcrop halfway up, the slope steeped and became icy. Near the top there was significant wind slab. We tentatively summited at 0530 having set off at 1am. We recorded the height as 5700m and the position 36.53440N 75.36591E and quickly headed back to the ABC.\n9th June\nHaving scanned the map we had we identified a peak marked as P5547 in the basin opposite to the peak we’d climbed the previous day. We got up in the morning at 1am and headed back along the moraine that makes up the edge of the pass and down crossing the glacier and up the other side to the North West. We attempted to gain the summit by heading up the corniced ridge at the back of the basin, but once we were on the ridge it looked far too unstable to attempt so we headed back down, taking note of the other peaks that we could attempt from there.\n10th June\nRest at BC\n11th June\nRest at BC.\n12th June\nHeaded across the pass and over the glacier on the far side. We set up a camp next to the ridge eventually leading up to Koh-e-Brobar. Our bivi was at 36.55560N 75.37576E at 4947m.\n13th June\nWoke at 11pm to heavy snow and went back to sleep. Woke again at 0130 to clearing skies and fairly cold temperatures. We headed up the 35-40 degree slope behind the tent till we made the ridgeline. The ridge carried on for around 4km, passing sweeping cornices reminiscent of the Rochefort Arête and some rocky pinnacles which were interesting to get around. We had reached the shoulder at the base of Koh-e-Brobar at 0745 and decided to head down rather than risk getting caught in the increasingly warm snow, a huge slab and sunk beneath us moments earlier. Turning back felt pretty good though, the route up to that point had been amazing.\n14th June\nBack at BC. Heavy Snow.\n15th June\nBC. More snow.\n16th June\nWe head up to our original ABC and got ready to attempt the slope behind us to the summit behind the camp.\n17th June\nA clear and cold night meant we were optimistic as we started up the slope. As we neared the top it got looser and looser and lost time wading in snow that at time was up to our chests. It was hard going but the view from the top ridgeline was breathtaking. We moved together along the slope until we neared the chossy looking summit. Will belayed Tim as he edged up the rocky summit, turning back promptly after finding no gear and it actively falling down (36.53891N 75.34747E 5503m). After descending in warming snow we got back to the ABC at about 0730.\nAt 1600 we packed up our bivi gear and set out to put a camp in the basin near the basin we’d unsuccessfully attempted the previous week.\n18th June\nSet off at 0130 under another crystal clear sky and lots of shooting stars. We headed up the easy gully to the north of the bivi and found it to be in good condition with short sections of ~55 ice. The ridge that followed was long and gentle, with a tough slope in the middle. As we went above 5700m the snow deteriorated, it hadn’t consolidated. We summited at 0545 and the weather was perfect so we took a few minutes to take it all in. We got back to the tent at 0730 and back to BC at 1100. James had a letter from his supervisor which ATP had somehow managed to hand deliver to us!\n19th June\nBC. Snow\n20th June\nBC. More Snow\n21st June\nMoved the ABC across Boesam pass to a new location at 36.56601N 75.35483E 5050m. The weather was pretty awful but we were all happy to be out of the BC and doing something.\n22nd June\nAnother day at BC.\n23rd June\nWe headed back to our new ABC and walked slightly up into the valley towards the prominent spur in it’s center. We planned our accent up it’s south side and then heading west along the ridge to the two summits at the top.\n24th June\nWe set off from the ABC at 1am and followed the tracks we’d made the previous day, continuing on to the base of the ridge. A light fog made it hard to see the way up we’d identified the day before. We roped up and headed up a south facing slope. The snow was of poor quality and we had to tread carefully to prevent ourselves from breaking through. After negotiating a steep rocky section we attained the ridge and then passed a number of rocky pillars as the sun rose at about 4am. We continued up the ridgeline with fairly big cornices on our right, eventually making it to the 55° slope at it’s far end. After Will broke through the first cornice we continued along the narrow ridge after the first summit and Tim dug through the second to make the higher of the two summits. We summited at 0715 at 36.57321N 75.32016E and recorded the height from our GPS at 5960m. Turning round fairly quickly we retraced our steps, and a 100m or so after leaving the second steep section the slope avalanched to the right, shearing just 5m in front of us. After deliberating about what to do, we decided to carry on as carefully as we could. We passed more avalanche debris eventually dropping off North about 500m ahead of the point we’d joined the ridge. The three of us returned to the tent at 1015.\nIn the afternoon Tim and I headed off to set up a bivi beneath the slope to the north of the ridge we’d just climbed. We made a plan to head up this slope and then west along the ridge to the peak we estimated to be slightly higher than the previous day.\n25th June\nTim and Will set off from their camp at 1230 at 5300m and headed up the south facing slope to the left of a large slanting buttress. The snow was of fairly poor quality again but we decided to push on to the ridge to see what it was like there. We reached the ridgeline and headed along to a high point of 5750m at 0230 before deciding to turn back as the snow quality was so poor. We got back to the tent at 0330 and after a nap we headed back to the ABC to meet James. The three of us broke the camp at 0930 and headed back to the BC.\n26th June\nRest at BC\n27th June\nWith rising night time temperatures and a terrible forecast for the next week we decided to call and end to our climbing attempts and spend the remaining time exploring a nearby valley. We called our porters and arranged for them to come and pick us up on the morning of the 29th June.\nAfter breakfast we headed to Shipedin Pass with Imtiaz. An incredibly chossy path lead up to a snowy pass and a brilliant view.\n28th June\nWe waited for our porters at BC and enjoyed more brilliant food from Arman.\n29th June\nMet the porters who had brought a huge number of donkeys with them and headed back to Samina Beig’s hut.\n30th June\nWalked back to Shimshal and went back to the guesthouse.\n1st July\nExplored the Malenguti Glacier and bivied that evening near a small hamlet at it’s foot.\n2nd July\nSpent the last day resting in Shimshal and went to Imtiaz’s family home for dinner.\n3rd July\nLeft at 0800 and started the drive back down the valley. Arrived in Karimabad and checked in to our rooms at the hotel.\n4th July\nWent into Aliabad and got haircuts and a shave and walked back to Karimabad in the afternoon.\n5th July\nWent to Altit fort in Karimabad and then drove back to Gilgit to stay in a hotel there and wait for our flight the next morning. Met Franz Nodari who had also been on expedition and was heading home with us.\n6th July\nFlight cancelled so we drove for about 16 hours on the KKH.\n7th July\nHad a tour of Islamabad with Sami from ATP.\n8th July\nFlew back to the UK Permits\nWe initially applied for a trekking permit for the Chapursan Valley and were told by the GBC (Gilgit-Baltistan Council) that we’d need a liaison officer. We agreed to this but were then told that our application had been refused regardless. A week later the GBC had reversed their decision. It’s still unclear whether this area is in the “open zone”. If you are traveling there its worth applying for the permits in good time and having your visas sorted beforehand will probably speed things up. Although applying for a visa without a specific area confirmed is theoretically problematic (according to Gerry’s visa services).\nAfter our initial refusal we changed plans and applied for an NOC (No objection certificate) visit the area around Shimshal. This wasn’t required but ATP thought it wise to make our passage through the area as smooth as possible. Since returning home we’ve read that visitors are now required to have an NOC but the situation seems to change all the time. In any case, it is not possible to arrange for either of these forms without a Gilgit-Baltistan based agent.\nFinances Income MEF Grant £ 2000 Chris Walker Memorial Trust Grant £ 1000 Imperial College London Exploration Board Grant £ 3000\nTotalling £ 6,000\nExpenditure Flights £ 1324 Visas £ 402 Agency Fee £ 468 Transport and Accommodation £ 2142 Porters and Staff £ 3330 Insurance £ 1425 Food and Fuel £ 987 Equipment Hire £ 391 Gas and Hill Food £ 350 Misc (Sat phone etc) £ 300 Equipment Purchase (Boots, sleeping bags etc) £ 2400\nTotalling £ 13,521\nBalance – Members Contributions\nWe transferred around £7500 to ATP before we arrived in Pakistan. They handled all of our bookings and most of the food. James acted as treasurer for the duration of the trip. We still had to carry about $500 dollars with us for tips and other misc. items. Dollars are accepted in larger stores everywhere, although people prefer to be paid in Rupees. Insurance\nWe used the BMC to arrange our insurance which was underwritten by Antares – Syndicate 1274 at Lloyd’s. We had to send additional contingency plans signed by ATP with details of security to get insured for travel on the KKH which is advised against by the FCO (only area surrounding Chilas). Logistics\nATP arranged all of our travel and the movement of our equipment when we arrived in the country. When we flew to Gilgit our bags were sent on the bus. The plane to Gilgit is often canceled, as we found on our return leg. Gas is readily available in Karimabad for stoves (about $7 for a 250g canister). Porters were easy to arrange in Shimshal although we think we benefited enormously from having ATP there to help with the negotiation. We paid just under $50 per porter for them to move a 25 kg load in three stages. Food and Accommodation\nWe were incredibly happy to have Arman with us on the trip while we were at basecamp. He provided fantastic and massive meals for us three times a day and tea and biscuits whenever we needed. For the climbs themselves we brought with us 15Kg of freeze dried meals from Extreme Foods. These were very tasty but we lacked variety even with 7 options. Accommodation was booked by ATP, but there never seemed to be any trouble in just arriving at a hotel unannounced. Communications\nWe hired a Thuraya satellite phone from ATP. It didn’t charge and we had to get a replacement which left us without communications for a number of days in the middle of the trip. We neglected to arrange VHF which was a mistake. While all other satellite phones are notionally banned in the country it seems feasible to get one in the country without much hassle. Political and Security Situation\nWhile there were security personnel everywhere we generally felt very safe, certainly as we left Gilgit and headed north. We are not sure why our permit for Chapursan was initially refused but its proximity to the Afghan border probably played a part. Equipment\nAn excellent guide is found here http://www.alpine-club.org.uk/ac2/eic-equipment. If we were to go again we would have taken some comfy basecamp shoes, a bigger better solar panel and lots more batteries! Medical Arrangements\nA comprehensive medical kit should obviously be taken on any expedition traveling to a remote area. We didn’t find any circumstance that wouldn’t have been covered by a routine expedition medical kit. Comprehensive information on pre-trip vaccination can easily be obtained from Fit For Travel. Both the Royal Geographical Societies and the Oxford Handbook of Expedition Medicine are excellent resources. Over the course of the expedition members experienced a number of minor ailments: Firstly diarrhea which was treated with Imodium and codeine when needed, secondly minor wound infection which was treated with flucloxacillin and one incidence of painful breathing probably due to over breathing dry air which was treated with rest and codeine. Photography\nThere were no photography restrictions in Shimshal or the surrounding area. Some locals had cameras and most people wanted their photos taking! I found John Griffiths guide on mountain photography extremely useful having not really known much before the trip. http://alpineexposures.com/phototips/mountain-photography-tips-part-1 Conclusion\nAfter a bumpy start with our permits being rejected for the Chapursan valley and then finding access to the Virjerab Glacier impossible we were extremely pleased to be able to climb anything, let alone make seven attempts on peaks, some of them unclimbed. The conditions were generally poor and we were forced to climb in the very early hours of the day. Despite this the routes were very enjoyable and there is potential to climb others in the area, the most interesting being unnamed peak 3 (marked F in diagrams in this report), which stands at just over 6000m. Acknowledgements\nFirst we’d like to thank Ben Coope and Tom Wheeler who sadly couldn’t make it on the trip due to injury in the few months leading up to the expedition. Like the rest of us they put a huge amount of effort into planning and training for the trip and it was gutting that they couldn’t come with us. Tom in particular deserves thanks as he acted as our liaison in the UK while we were away relaying messages to our friends and family. Hopefully they’ll be able to come on the next one!\nSecond we’d like to thank the members of the Imperial College Exploration board, in particular Lorraine Craig and Phil Power. Their help and encouragement in the lead up to the expedition was invaluable and we hope that the board continues to support expeditions of this nature in the future and provide students of Imperial College London with the expertise and information they need to make them happen.\nWe also need to thank Bruce Normand and Pete Thompson for their advice and contacts. The expedition nearly didn’t happen but Bruce’s encouragement and suggestions meant we managed to re plan our trip a week before we flew from the UK. Pete took the time to call me and offer his help with the huge number of questions I had before we left which was incredibly useful. My biggest piece of advice to anybody considering their first expedition would be to contact people who have been to the area before as soon as possible.\nWe would also like to thank the many members of the Mount Everest Foundation advisory committee and the Chris Walker Memorial Trust for their invaluable time and support. Extreme Foods for feeding us. ATP for their help, contacts and hospitality. Arman for his cooking, and Imtiaz for his local knowledge and hard work.ICMC and the Exploration Society at Imperial College London for teaching us to climb and getting us excited about alpinism in the first place. Our friends and family for not thinking we were completely mad!\nAppendix A - Details of Glacier Movement Access to the Virjerab glacier from Shimshal was not possible without ice climbing which the porters of Shimshal are not capable of (they only have trainers). The Khurdopin glacier had slipped forwards creating a zone of massive crevasses. Tim and James managed to reach 36.340172N 75.47144E wearing trainers, but at too high risk for porters with heavy loads. Further passage was blocked by a crevasse 3 meters wide and several kilometers long. It was not possible to walk in front of the glacier as a river runs between the glacier nose and the valley wall.\nCondition of Khurdopin glacier Interestingly NASA pointed the Landsat 8 satellite at the area on the 13th May 2017 just before we arrived. More details on the so called “Karakorum Anomaly” can be found here: https://www.ukclimbing.com/articles/page.php?id=8106\nAn image showing the glacier’s progress down the valley taken by NASA Landsat 8 13th May 2017 https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=90672 The location Tim and James turned back is shown in red.\n","date":"2017-07-01T00:00:00Z","image":"YAYAYA/YAYAYA/YAYAYA/p/boesam-pass-expedition-2017/images/cover_hu_b3d224e6f195abed.jpg","permalink":"YAYAYA/p/boesam-pass-expedition-2017/","title":"Boesam pass expedition 2017"},{"content":"ICMC Winter Tour Report Cairngorms 4th - 10 th Jan 2015 As has been the case for the last few years the club returned to the Cairngorms. Our usual accommodation just behind the train station in Aviemore was not available as the trip ran later in the year than usual. Instead we stayed in Nethy Bridge, about 20 minutes further away. The trip saw mild conditions turning colder as the week went on.

Headed over to Fiacaill Coulouir (III) which was a bit bare at the top but a brilliant route non-the less, they then dropped off back to the carpark down Fiacaill Ridge which was bare and in summer condition.\nNicolau honed his self arresting skills, Charlie lost his white helmet in the snow and Cat started her winter skills course with Cairngorm Adventure Guides.\nKnut cooked us all an interesting German noodle dish, which was very very very filling.

Everybody else went up and round the back of Lochan topping out through The Couloir (I/II), we then headed over to Ben Macdui and then finally down the goat track. A brilliant day ended with some yummy carbonara which was mainly cream.\nKnut having just negotiated the icy step in the middle of The Couloir (I/II)\nCat half way up Central Gully (I)\nDay 4 A warmer day meant we headed back to Cummingstone on the Moray Coast, about an hours drive north. After a good experience last year we were not disappointed again, climbing the relatively short and welcoming crags on the coastline is welcome relief from being blasted by spindrift on the tops of the Cairngorm Plateau. A local, who we had met the previous day heading back to the car park, congratulated us on our decision to head to ‘Marvoulous Moray’ it seems to be the place to go when the weather turns a bit naff in the mountains. We had roast pork for dinner and filled the house with roast potatoes.\nSome of us went for a swim.\nJo on something overhung and cool.\nDay 5 Great conditions! We split the groups up a little as Cat had just finished her course and Georgia was joining us from Liverpool MC. Jo, James and Nicolau completed Red Gully (II) and found the torque nut that Will had left earlier in the week. Jon, Knut and Chris climbed the seam (IV), Tom Charlie and Sally climbed Central Gully and Will Georgia and Cat climbed the Runnel which was very icy at the top!

We cooked about 10 litres of fish pie for dinner.\nCar park reindeer\nDay 7 Poor conditions, extremely high winds (+130mph), and a warm outlook mean that we cut the trip short and headed home.\nFinancial Breakdown Tiny profit due to some rounding errors in ticket income calculation.

Harry turned out to be a little worse for wear and had forgotten his passport. After a quick call to his dad it was agreed that the two busses and the car would rendezvous at the ferry terminal ready for the morning crossing.\nOne bus arrived earlier, crossed on its own, both busses and the car all got lost independently and took different routes around Paris. We eventually ended up at Pres Camping south of Fountainbleu.\nDay 2 We got up early and had eggy bread, then headed over to boulder for the day. It was very hot and sunny, a slack line was set off and a few of us played boules while we enjoyed lunch.\nThe first of many games of danger boules.\nDay 3 Harry.\nThis day involved hundreds and hundreds of miles of driving. Luckily there were loads of drivers and we had lots of food. At one point Jo stopped wearing trousers and decided that the heated seats in the car were all a bit much. Late in the evening the red bus was hit by an oncoming van which destroyed the wing mirror, and the passenger side window. Thankfully nobody was hurt, though there was a lot of glass everywhere. A nearby irrigation system ensured that everybody in the windowless van stayed refreshed, which was great.\nWe arrived in Palud Sur Verdon at around 11:30 pm and found the road leading up to the valley a bit exciting; the enormous drop to the right of the driver and sharp bends made sure that everybody was still awake. We arrived at the wrong campsite and put up the tents.\nDay 4 After waking up and realising that the campsite was wrong and rubbish, we de-camped and headed into town to try and find where we were meant to go. We immediately found Jean- Paul camping and headed over to pop the tents up. We then went to one of the shorter and supposedly more accessible crags in the area. After an hour of swearing and bashing through shrubs we arrived and got a decent afternoons climbing in, introducing the novices in the group to the techniques they’d need over the coming week.\nJo and James doing some of the very pleasant routes at the single pitch crag a little way down the valley.\nDay 5 We headed over to a multi-pitch crag that didn’t involve any abseiling to give people some experience of the rope work before we committed to bigger routes. In the afternoon we headed down to the river for a swim!\nDay 6 We knew that if we wanted to get anything big done while we were there we’d have to get used to the exposure presented by the enormous cliffs. To do this we spent the next day at one of the many abseil points at the edge of the road. Lots of tourists were taking our photos!\nDay 7, 8 \u0026amp; 9 Having taught people what they needed to know we split into three’s and took a series of groups to different multipitch crags over the next three days. The routes ranged from enormous crack and chimney climbs to interesting arête’s. Notably Ben and Amar tackled La Demande, one of the more famous routes in the area. Groups that didn’t do multipitch routes headed to abseil points along the roadside or along the valley to the extremely impressive Hulk area; a large scoop/ cave with some really interesting and challenging single pitch climbs. Handily it also stayed dry when the rest of the area was wet!\nTemperature inversion in the valley\nGeorgia climbing above the river on a 9 pitch route.\nMilan and Sam on their first multipitch route, l’arete belvedere\nDay 10 After a tiring few days we headed down to the river to wind down for a bit.\nDay 11 The group went over to the Hulk area because of poor weather. The crag is in the middle of a series of ladders and narrow paths which allows for pretty big exposure in relative safety. On the opposite side of the valley a few people experienced the total darkness of the 1.5km long tunnel which runs along the river. Milan and Anthony got a bit stuck on their route so Ben and Amar shot up an adjacent route to help them out after their abseil line got stuck after they completed their route. Everybody got down in time for a late dinner though Milan and Anthony owed a lot of people a lot of drinks.\nMilan climbing in Hulk\nDay 12 In the final day in Verdon the weather turned for the worse, those who hadn’t yet done it had a go at the via–ferrata which was about the only thing that was safe to do in the weather. The rest of the group had a relaxing day at the campsite and sorted the mountains of equipment out! The trip was rounded off with a meal at the local restaurant in Palud Sur Verdon.\nDay 13 We left Verdon and headed north making the campsite just south of Paris by 10 pm. Chilli was cooked hastily while a fire was built. Lunch and snack stops were spent at some of the many roadside picnicking areas that the cover much of the French road network.\nDay 14 After a quick stop at the wine shop we caught the ferry home and remarked on how great cat-eyes were in the UK.\n","date":"2014-09-08T00:00:00Z","image":"YAYAYA/YAYAYA/YAYAYA/p/summer-tour-2014-verdon-gorge/images/4_hu_fe6ac48be20552ca.jpg","permalink":"YAYAYA/p/summer-tour-2014-verdon-gorge/","title":"Summer tour 2014 - Verdon Gorge"},{"content":"Sunday 30th March to Thursday the 10th April\n30th March Rushes are made through the airport as some people accidentally got on guided tours of south London instead of the easy bus to Stansted. Everyone makes it on the plane after some luggage is moved around to make the weights fit. Once in Antalya we meet the driver set to take us to our campsite. We arrive too late for dinner and in conditions too dark to see how close the cliffs are. People eat and find their way to their tent rooms.\n31 st March Teaching day. We head to an easy, short section of the cliffs, trekking through the undergrowth for approximately 30 seconds having left the campsite. People realise that climbing outside is more difficult when you can’t see where all the holds are. In the afternoon people travel into the nearest village to buy supply’s.\n1st April Happy that most of the fresher’s can lead we head to the other end of the cliff where there climbing is more varied. Here we watch over the novices to make sure everything goes to plan but also have an opportunity to push for some harder grades with Neo climbing a 6b. We retire to the campsite to cook dinner and drink beers and soft drinks.\n2nd April We head for the main sector. The larger cliff boasts some of the more impressive routes of the area, including Barbarossa, a secret climb found only by those who know where it is. Almost everyone climbs this bizarre route which ends with a section of caving out onto the face of the cliff. People greatly enjoy this.\n3rd April Rest for some as a group take some of the local street dogs on a walk up to some ancient ruins. En route they find a tortoise. His name Is Pete. Pete the tortoise. They put him back and continue walking the dogs until they can hardly hear the screams of people falling off their projects, safely. Others refuse to rest and continue climbing until they run out of finger skin.\n4th April Project day. Everyone is happy that they can climb in groups by themselves and as a result people break away and head to climb whatever they want, all within minutes’ walk of the campsite. These people try harder routes that they can’t climb at first, some of them even fall off without shouting ‘take’. This is good. Jamie finds a 7b, Will looks for a 7a and others continue climbing in new sectors, gaining experience all the while. More people head into town to buy more supplies. Laura’s ability to speak Turkish has now become a vital part of tour logistics.\n5th April More projects, people spend the morning heading to projects or going off to explore the small amount of multi pitching available in the area. Ben finds a 7b+ project, defiantly not chosen as it was behind his tent and within applauding range of the campsite. So modest. In the afternoon a sectret crag is found where the floor seems to be entirely made of sheep poo. This turns out to be correct. Unfortunately this can’t make up for the difficult nature of the climbing there so people head back out through the trap door to the crag and back down the road.\n6th April Everyone decides to head into the village to experience the local market and grab some grub authentic grub for lunch. We have a race into town which is won by Jamie and Ben. They celebrate by drinking beer and soft drinks. Will arrives in a lorry and the others soon appear. Most of the group manage to avoid buying fake beats headphones and make it to the food end of the market. What a delight, Turkish delight that is. Gifts are bought for loved and liked ones out of a sense of duty and people head to a little hut to eat Gözlemes. They are tasty, savoury, pancake-like naan bread things with stuff in them, and they are cheap. Full of fillings people make their way back to the campsite and some even do some climbing. Ben sends his project, no one cares.\n7th April Fun day to Olympos. Two cars are rented and driven to the coast. Here we enjoy a local brunch before sauntering to the beach. Some head out to look for climbs and find wondrous 7a’s that they send and then return to meet the others. Walking down the beach, everyone stops off for a tasty sea side dinner of fish and meats and beers and soft drinks. As the sun goes down everyone has a cheeky boulder by the sea and some choose to brave the refreshing sea waters with their pants on. Eventually everyone returns to the cars and heads back to the campsite.\n8th April Tired, some people work their projects but most cherry pick easier climbs in relaxed fashion. Federico unfortunately takes a bit of a tumble, catching his foot as he is caught by the rope. He is first aided back to camp and splinted. People are sad for Federico, but Federico is still happy, as always. That night people reminisce about the trip they are on as they realise that there are only a few days left to send.\n9th April Sending day and everyone’s on form. Jamie narrowly misses sending his 7b, Ben waddles his way up a 7c and everyone seems happy with the marked improvement in their climbing both physically and from a technical proficiency angle. AS Federico is still in pain he is taken to ER and patched up properly, he returns gloriously with a crutch and a smile. Everyone celebrates with food and beer and soft drinks with the street dogs and cats they have befriended.\n10th April People pack their bags and ferry onto the bus back to the airport. Using Laura, we find our flight and Federico is wheeled away. Once everyone has explained to the security that Ben is not a terror suspect, he is allowed to take his quick draws onto the plane and everyone settles down. In London people say their goodbyes but only till term starts again.\nNote to Reader It may seem that not a lot happened on this holiday but due to the vicinity and ease with which it was possible to climb nearly un ending number of routes, people spent most of the holiday revelling in the ecstasy that is summer sport climbing.

Another important objectives was to teach less experienced members of the club how to winter climb, so that the skills and knowledge that they acquired would stay in the club and be passed on in later years. There were five students who took part in the introductory course, at least four of which will be staying on Imperial fot at least another year, and so this was also a success.\nTrip List Jo Robbings Tim Seers Tom Wheeler Will Smith Knut Holzner Martin Milon Charlie Penny Nicolau Sarquirs Harry Stuart-­‐Smith Tom Penny James Weale Diary Day 1: 15th December After an early start of meeting at 7am, we packed up the bus at lightning speed and were soon on the road facing a 14 hour journey to Scotland. The drive went smoothly with only a few Traffic jams, and we stopped en route to carry out our food shop for the week. This turned out to be super efficient, as we split into smaller groups and charged round the shop grabbing the items we needed. We were soon back on the bus on the way to the house. We arrived at the house in the late evening. After greeting the Argor, we all went to shotgun rooms. Joel and Will were particularly fast at claiming their double bed. As the only girl on the trip, Jo claimed her own room, and the rest of the group split between the other rooms.\nDay 2: 16th December Our guide Kevin arrived early in the morning, and went through some general safety with the novices. It was decided that the weather would be too bad to go out into the mountains, and so instead we head up to Cummingston, Elgin, a crag well known for staying dry when the weather is bad further north.\nThis well named crag turn out to be very idyllic, and Kevin spent the day teaching novices rope work techniques that would be useful in winter climbing. The rest of the group played around the coastline trad routes, which were all great fun.\nDay 3: 17th December On the second day of Kevin\u0026rsquo;s course the weather was a bit better, and so he took the novices out into the mountains to teach winter skills. The rest of the group split in two -­‐ Will and Jo went on a walk that did not require crampons (due to the group lacking one set of them), and the others went up a grade I route on the Coire an t’Sneachda. All of the parties had great amount of fun, and even the sun decided to join them in the afternoon for a while. Jo and Will took the extremely scenic route back to the bus, which involved cross country walking through bracken and snow.\nDay 4: 18th December The group split into teams of threes, with one novice going with two experienced members. We all climbed on different routes across the Coire an t’Sneachda. Although incredibly windy, the weather held out throughout the day, and all of the teams eventually topped out successfully.\nDay 5: 19th December Due to bad weather conditions, the group took an enforced rest day. The gear was sorted and cleaned, and we had a walk into Aviemore town to peruse the gear shops before deciding not to buy anything. Charlie, Tom and Jo went on a walk in the local area. The rest of the team stayed in the house watching Scottish TV, before driving over to Inverness to watch the new Anchorman II film. The evening was spent continuously refreshing the weather forecast in hope of good conditions for day six.\nDay 6: 20nd December After initial concerns about the weather, an update showed that the conditions would be fine for climbing, and so the minibus set off for Coire an t’Sneachda. This time a couple of teams head over to Coire an Lochain. The day was semi-­‐successful. The conditions,\nalthough not terrible, gave a lot of spindrift on the routes, and very powdery snow. Many of the teams decided to retreat after experiencing issues on the routes, such as large cornices when trying to top out. Retreating meant late returns to the bus, and as the car park was closed at night, a couple of the teams, on eventually reaching the car park, then had to walk down the hill to the barrier. Once all back at the house, clothing was strewn over the Argor, and dramatic tales of defeat were shared at the dinner table.\nDay 7: 21nd December After the various defeats of the previous day, and with the conditions set to continue worsening, it was decided to flee to the one dry tooling crag that Scotland has -­‐ Newtyle Quarry. Everyone spent some time scaring themselves on dry tooling routes in the pouring rain, before retiring to the pub. Once back at the house, an impressive effort was put into the dinner, and we all enjoyed a roast dinner with crumble for pudding.\nDay 8: 22nd December Home time! Everyone got up early, and an impressive group effort meant the bus was packed and the house cleaned in record time. We were soon on the road home, feeling psyched for next year’s Scottish winter climbing already.\nFinancial Breakdown Income Novice Members Contribution: £215 Experienced Members Contribution: £190 IC Trust Contribution: £232.80 Total: £2,472.80 Expenditure Minibus: £554.

For members to improve their sport climbing ability. To experience and take advantage of a much better standard of sport climbing than is available in the UK. There is no doubt that the tour fulfilled its objectives. Everyone had a great time, the quality of sport climbing was excellent, and many people boosted their sport climbing grade by a substantial amount; Sam and Milan boosted their grades from 6a+ to 6c and I went from climbing 6c+ to 7b.\nAttendees Will Macleod Andrew Wilkins Hamzah Shami Antje Lenhart Jakov Marelic Cheehan Weereratne Dak Scott Michael Chan Rosanna Nichols Sam Cockman Milan Thakore Jack Beanland Amar Nanda Will Smith Charlie Penny Friday, September 6th The first seven of us took our flight in today. Hamzah reinforced his position of club chopper by trying to bring the most lethal looking ice screw I’ve ever seen onto the plane. The security were nice enough not to arrest him, but he did lose his ice-screw-dagger. We arrived in Reus at around 8pm and from there took a taxi straight to the campsite in Siurana. We were immediately greeted by the campsite owners who were really friendly, and kept the kitchen open late to get us all fed! After choosing our rooms in the campsite cabins and moving all our stuff in, we went to bed setting an alarm for an early start tomorrow.\nChoosing rooms\nSaturday, September 7th A thunderstorm looming overhead prevented people from doing much climbing in the morning\u0026hellip; off to a good start! Andy and I (Will) set off hitch-hiking to the nearby town Cornudella, to buy food supplies for the next few days. Other than getting hopelessly lost and accidentally hitch-hiking to a huge dam this was successful. Meanwhile the rest of the group spent the day slacklining and meeting other climbers on the campsite. Hannes – one guy we met – was kind enough to drive some of us to a crag later on in the day when it had dried out. Cheehan, Dak and Rosanna arrived today!\nHamzah showing off his slacklining skills\nSunday, September 8th We are all up early to head to a nearby crag – Can Marges - which has a range of easy and hard routes for the day. Everyone gets a good few climbs in. At midday it gets really hot so we have a break, and after another thunderstorm at 5 we head back. This was our first real go on Spanish rock as a group, and everyone founds the climbs hard. This rock will take some getting used to!\nMonday, September 9th The bulk of the group headed to Can Parasit to climb in the morning. We were lucky to have Hannes to drive some of us into town for food shopping! Everyone regroups at the campsite at 4 and then heads back out to Can Parasit. Some of us take fall practice to get confidence sport climbing and some hard routes are attempted until it gets dark.\nTuesday, September 10th Up super early. Scrambled eggs. The majority of people leave to Can Parasit again as it was popular yesterday. Me Amar Michael and Hannes drive to Arboli, a beautiful crag just out of walking distance. We climb a variety of routes ranging from 6a to 7b+. We had something loosely resembling Piella for tea, took advantage of the unpolluted sky stargazing, then all retreated to bed!\nHannes finding a no-hands rest on his 7b+\nMe on a scarily run-out 6b+\nWednesday, September 11th We spent the day at Grau del Masetes. There was a nice section of wall with a range of easier routes that became the social hub of the crag. Lunch was Local baguettes with a monstrous portion of nutella. Michael won chopper of the day award by trying to climb one face of a chimney problem making it magnitudes harder, and benighting a small group of us by getting a rope stuck at the top of a route!\nHamzah spectating the 6b climb\nAmar attempting the 6b climb\nThursday, September 12th We went to Grau del Masetes again. A portion of the day was spent trying a 6a and 6a+ overhang at the ‘social hub’ of the crag. We also spent a long time all trying a classic 6b nearby, with Michael taking photos from a rope he had set up next to the route.\nFriday, September 13th Rest day today! Much slacklining was done! A number of people visited Siurana village during the day. Charlie, Sam, Will Smith, Milan and Jack arrived later today. Amar had to go back, and the campsite owners were kind enough to offer to drive him all the way to Reus themselves! (A two hour round trip)\nHamzah displaying some actual skill on a slackline\nSaturday, September 14th After a morning excursion through a small jungle to a crag we wrongly thought would be big enough for all of us, we headed to Can Melafots. This is the famous crag at Siurana, and with good reason! It consists of a long stretch of amazing overhanging red rock, overlooking a beautiful view of the lake nearby. It was obvious this crag would be visited many more times this trip!\nJack on ‘pizza de pinya’ 7a\nSunday, September 15th Due to a number of complaints about it being too hot, some people went to a shaded crag, Reserva India. The rest of the group headed to Can Melafots again.\nJakov and Cheehan enjoying the Spanish rock\nWill at Can Melafots\nMonday, September 16th We spent the day at Grau del Masetes, to show the new-comers the crag. A number of people had a go at a short 7a+ with a really hard boulder move at the top. Only Jack got it! Since everyone feels pretty spent we decided upon a rest day tomorrow. This is great news because it allows us to indulge in all the Spanish wine we can get our hands on with no fear of climbing hung-over!\nWill and Sam looking fabulous\nWill at Can Melafots\nTuesday, September 17th Finally a full rest-day! Everyone had a big lie-in and then we trekked down to the lake for some swimming. A herd of goats pestered us when we were all sitting by the lake. From the lake we headed to Town to buy food and have a few drinks.\nWill failing to swim\nWednesday September 18th Me, Antje, Will Smith, Charlie, Milan, Jack and Jakov left early to go to the crag El Detot. The rest were chilling out or climbing at Can Melafots. Michael got his 7c project, and I got a 7a I had been trying.\nMilan at El Detot\nWill at El Detot\nThursday September 19th Today is the last day of real climbing! Everyone with projects they want to do has to get the today! Me and Michael had a 7b and 7c+ project at Can Melafots to finish. I got the 7b and was given a gummy-bear as a reward. We all drank a lot with dinner and for some reason had a food-fight with spaghetti\u0026hellip;\nWill on Hostia 7b\nA nice view of us on Melafots\nFriday September 20th We got the campsite owners to order us a taxi for 3:30. The morning was spent packing and clearing up the huts, primarily removing spaghetti from the walls.

Fully packed and we only forgot the map and first aid kit. Our impressive start was only foiled slightly by traffic jams and we managed to make it to Milkins’ house by midnight. Luxurious conditions were experienced by all, mostly Ruth and Rosanna who were assigned a ‘girls’ room\nMurray declined his invitation. Ben, Sam and Will couldn’t decide which of them should be thrown out of the double bed and had an uncomfortable night’s sleep with minimal spooning.\nSecond day – Saturday 6:15 – porridge making begins! Blinkers were put on by all trip attendees with possibly the quickest departure ever for a morning\u0026hellip; all in vain as by the time we got to Brimham Rocks (after a brief pause to remove a bag of sick [courtesy of Andy Moore] from the bus) it was snowing sideways and the rock could have been described as ‘a bit damp’.\nMilkins climbed a stream (VDiff) whilst everyone else had a walk around and a bit of a boulder on the 2m of dry wall. After an hour or so the decision was made to go to The Depot indoor bouldering wall in Leeds. Much fun was had by all and we met up with Alumni! Then went to the pub. Tasty chilli was made in record time ready for the evening premier – ‘Vertical Limit’ a highly accurate documentary about mountain rescue.\nThird day – Sunday After the overly keen wake up time and late bed time Ruth decided to have a lie in (07:30), but we still managed to have a highly efficient departure with the bouldering pads being loaded onto the roof (controversial and effective) no one was sick on the way to the crag! Almscliff offered dry rock, snow flurries and occasional sunshine with first leads from Sietse who found some amusing gear placements (in a good way) and Harry who found a place for Bens big cam (size5?); Jakov and Rosanna learning how to lead belay with halves; Kip pretending to be a seal (see photo) and getting hot aches;\nTim successfully leading the famous Yorkshire grade of MVS; Davie, Ben, Ali and Will doing some hard bouldering (some Joeling involved);Phil, Nicolau and\nSam getting some routes in (Ruth checking gear/anchors); Murray and Johan getting some trad on with Murray having to break through the ice in a puddle to top out a rather tricky looking route at the end of the day.

The car and bus were packed and we set off to Wales via a Sainsburys at around 2pm. We arrived at the hut hassle free, at about 11pm. The next day marked the first day of climbing. With the LLanberis pass being closed, going to Tramadog had to be cancelled and instead an attempt was made to climb some of the boulders at the roadside crag in the Cromlech. Here it was very cold and windy so the party quickly bailed into the bus stop quarry for a spot of easy sport climbing.\nDay 2 saw successful passage to Tramadog and the first day of trad climbing. Novices were introduced to the world of multi pitch trad, climbing with more experienced members of the trip. A pleasant time was had by all, pootling up some HS’s. Meanwhile the boulderers were climbing around the Bustach boulders with Will climbing his first V7. Once everyone had reconvened at Tremadog, the bus took people back to the hut and the car took some boulderers off to Elephantitus for an evening session seeing a few more hard sends.\nDay 4 was a rest day spent wandering about gear shops and staring at rocks from a distance.\nDay 5 split the tour into sport climbers and boulderers. The sport climbers were dropped off at the Castle Inn and the boulderers found themselves the cave. Everyone had a good day enjoying yet another improbably dry day. The boulderers suffered defeats across the board and vowed to return to finish projects.\nDay 6 was a return to the Cromlech where Jo eventually sent her first V but in general it was too cold for most people. That evening we retired to Ben’s house in southern Snowdonia as the hut became unavailable. Thefollowing day was sent resting, biking and slack lining here in secluded central wales.\nDay 8 again split the tour, the sport climbers dropped at Penmaen Head where Milkins sent his first 6b outdoors. The boulderers returned to battle in the cave with partial success. Jack just missed out on his V9 project, Jordan sent Clever Beaver V7, Chris climbed something hard and Ben sent his first V9, Rock Atrocity. All in all a respectable tick list.\nDay 9 was our last, making it back to Beit by 9:30pm.\nOverall the trip was a success, especially as the destination had to be changed at such short notice due to the lack of drivers. The trip was very cheap and we made the most of very fortunate weather. All the novices were introduced to multi pitch trad climbing and the trip maintained a relaxed feeling. Honourable mention to Chris, without his solo bus driving effort, the trip would not have been possible.\nFull list of Attendees\nBen Coope Jordan Ford Jack Beanland Chirs Hunt Bernie Wilkins Jakov Marelic Jo Robbings Will Macleod Rosana Nicols Alex Card Finances The trip cost a total of £1031.79, travel cost a total of £686.08 which is less than was originally budgeted for so only £257.28 of the funding was calculated as 37.5% of the travel cost of the trip. The trip then cost members a total of £ each. These figures are before the Union’s retrospective moderation.\nDifficulties \u0026amp; Objectives Due to mass drop out of drivers in the closing stages of organising the tour, the trip was almost cancelled but instead was rapidly switched to Wales at the last minute. This lead to the tour being, initially, quite disorganised. However, given the circumstances, the trip went as well as can be expected; with Christopher Hunt offering to do all of the driving and Benjamin Coope donating the use of his car. We managed to climb every day that we weren’t resting, there were no injuries and everyone had a great time. All the novices gained experience in climbing outdoors and the trip was run to the slimmest of budgets.\nAssorted photos\n","date":"2013-03-24T00:00:00Z","image":"YAYAYA/YAYAYA/YAYAYA/p/easter-tour-2013/images/2_hu_dfc8a9093cb71eb9.jpg","permalink":"YAYAYA/p/easter-tour-2013/","title":"Easter Tour 2013"},{"content":"By Jordan Ford\nAll is well that ends well. It is as they say!\nThis Fresher’s trip to the peak district started exceptionally strong, as we meant to go on, with two minibuses ram packed full of keen climbers, new and old, all raring to put one hand above the other in the name of increasing potential energy. After being enticed by our fantastic exhibition of excellence, intelligence and outright debauchery at fresher’s fair, the eager early members stared through misty windows with bright eyes as we escaped the flashing city lights in the crimson of the setting sun and made haste for the silence of the north. Silence that was soon to be broken.\nICMC – displaying the “what to do” huddle formation. A common sight in the outdoors.\nWe arrived in excellent time to the cold and familiar greetings that the unheated town hall we so often frequent had to offer. That and a thick downpour of rain.\nYes, the rumours from the men and women on the TV who love to smile and tell us we are to enter times of great sorrow, bleakness and sideways rain were true: 60% of the time, it rains all the time. But to those individuals on a\n£22,000 salary[1], we laughed, and said “ICMC eats misfortune and adversity for blunner (Breakfast, lunch and dinner all in one meal for people who do not have the time to eat[2])”.\nThe consumption of alcohol was neither encouraged nor condemned, as underlined by the new union rules regarding drinking in societies™©®. When people’s lips became dry in the harsh and cold winter weathers that so often swallow the peaks, we supplied necessary liquids in a variety of flavours, to combat such life threatening signs, with utmost vigilance and urgency.\nThe morning trundled lazily over the rolling hills of northern countryside that came in the form of pounding and wet rain. 2-0 meteorologists.\nIn no particular haste the most spectacular scent of real life pork meat and some-what eggs was sent in to the bedding chambers that housed at least 30 hungry individuals and caused a stir. The breakfast was expertly prepared by fresh president of all things metal and fabric, Ben Coope, with trusty assistants Tim Seers, Will Will Smith-Cloud and Jordan. YOU MUST CONSTRUCT ADDITIONAL PYLONS.\nTeam superchef hard at work stirring those some-what eggs. It takes threeeeee.\nAfter the small council met to decide the outcome of the day, two groups spit up; one visited the bouldering mecca known as the works, and the other to lay eyes upon the fantastic new Awesome Walls. Walls that outshone any lead walls for many miles. Rock climbing was out of the question, so plastic would have to suffice.\nThose at the works also had the option to do a spot of celebrity spotting and even climb a bit with them as Leah Crane, Dianne Merrick and Ned the baker were there. They were strong, we weren’t wrong.\nCooking chilli and exploring the psychological benefits of becoming a socialite and actually having a great conversation with people you’d never met. Everyone did so wonderfully.\nCarrots were, as laid down in the ICMC rules, regulations and traditions, “less than tender”.\nEvery passing hour from 11PM to 7PM seemed to merge in to one giant concoction of uncertainty, spontaneity and fun, perhaps with a few missing items of minor clothing splayed throughout the hall. Most people knew where, less what, and very few when it happened. But regarding the who, everyone was certain.\nTim, in the midst of demonstrating, with visual aides, how 12pm can turn into 3pm\nSunday followed the exact same proceedings, pretty much to the letter, as we became doomed to a life of London climbing. That is to say, on plastic.\nThis did not deter the newer members, whose wide-eyes still glistened with straight up keenness and psyche to pull. It was from this point on that the older members knew that these freshers were ready to join the leagues of ICMC members, and refresh the generation.\nWe eat hard, and climb lard.\nBibliography\n[1] – Meteorology salaries within the UK, Written by AGCAS editors, “http://www.prospects.ac.uk/meteorologist_salary.htm” (2013)\n[2] – MizsiEM, “http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Blunner” (2013)\n","date":"2013-01-01T00:00:00Z","image":"YAYAYA/YAYAYA/YAYAYA/p/freshers-trip-2013/images/0_hu_75673c078504ae88.jpg","permalink":"YAYAYA/p/freshers-trip-2013/","title":"Fresher's trip 2013"},{"content":"Journey to the Peak District This year’s fresher’s trip was another record breaker for number of members attending, 3 full minibuses and a car were required with many former members meeting us in the Peak District. Preparations for the trip were impressive with Joel organising a visit to Costco to buy vast quantities of cheap food before the trip which saved considerable amounts of money, so much so that we saw the return of bacon to ICMC. Loading of the 3 buses began at about 4 which allowed for departure before 6 for one of the buses and the other 2 were on the road before 7. The car driver was last to arrive and picked up the remaining people. The usual argument of the best way out of London ensued with everyone apparently taking different routes to eventually get to the M1.\nHeading north on the M1 was exceedingly boring this year with no major incidents resulting in an early arrival at the village hall. The bus driven by Murray and Caroline (and not Fails) had been given 2 different sets of directions on how to get to the hall, one by Joel which directed them to Derby and one set by Kip which directed them to the village hall. The directions from Kip were chosen so as it was suspected that Joel just wanted everyone to go to Derby again. Arriving at the village hall, it was discovered that the minibus which left first had arrived first and gone to the pub after shotgunning all the matts to sleep on, the car had also arrived ages before due to not being limited to 100kph.\nAfter letting the freshers stretch their legs a bit and play with some of the toys left in the village hall by other users they were put to bed by Joel who then retired to a private room with Stefan. Several freshers were fighting over who gets to sleep on the bouldering pads. This was allowed to continue until a winner was decided at which point an older member went over and informed them that sleeping on the pads was banned as it damages them. Freshers were sad until they were given a roll mat, all of which had been taken out the bus this year.\nDay 1 – Froggatt Edge Joel and Stefan were first up in the morning and spent an hour cooking bacon and eggs for people before waking everyone else up. Joel was enjoying the opportunity to model his ICMC braded clothing in the kitchen which looked fabulous. Once breakfast was ready everyone got out of their sleeping bags very quickly only to discover an unreasonable bread ration was being enforced of only 4 Green eggs and ham slices per day. Unfortunately Joel’s clothing clashed with the peculiarly coloured eggs, it seemed that Joel had bought the eggs rather a while ago and they were not the expected colour. The green eggs and ham were still eaten by many to make up for the shortages of other food. Loading the bus was another faff with people getting confused about which bus they were getting on. The first bus to leave left with an empty seat as they didn’t wait for everyone but karma caught up with them as they took the trap signpost to the village instead of the crag and lost their time advantage. Fortunately the car had a spare seat so nobody was left behind.\nLeaving first with all the equipment meant the first bus also had lots of fun caring everything to the crag while those who were last to arrive didn’t have to carry must at all. Amusing antics by the other 2 minibuses mean’t the first bus was also completely blocked in.\nTaking 50 people to a crag, even one as large as Frogatt would be a silly idea and would probably upset the locals, so half the trip carried on along the path to Curbar and Trackside. This venture was all bouldering and many boulders were climbed on. The people remaining at Froggatt all went trad climbing in groups of 3 which had been pre-allocated by Joel, another improvement on last years trip. However due this did cause some upset members who wanted to climb with their friends and those who wanted good belayers for harder climbs later in the day.\nInitially many easy climbs were done to let the new climbers get up a few things. No top ropes were set up by ICMC at all meaning that there was no route hogging which so many people get upset by. Additionally we avoided some of the 3 star classics as there tends to be a big queue for them and we didn’t want to add to this. There were 4 other university groups there as well which caused some confusion due to mistaken identity. One of the groups was from\nLoughbourgh and had previously been encountered in Fontainebleau, the notorious “Rapey Dave” was rumoured to be at the crag but was not found.\nJoel enjoyed the ultra-classic Toddy’s Wall (HVS) which it’s ridiculous cock over and overall outstanding quality. 2 ascents of three Pebble Slab (HVS) were attempted by Ben and Murray with Ben asking for a rope to be rescued and Murray manning up and finishing it. Tom climbed another mega classic called Chequers Buttress after camping at the bottom for 5 other people to go up it. Kip climbed his first E1 Strapiombante which was incredibly pumpy and no other clean ascents were made, even by his second. Murray did try it but fell off/pusseyed out on the last move. Kips victory is in addition to using his band new aliens which did not explode when used which is an impressive feet in its own right.\nNot everyone had such a productive day out. Andy fell off one of his climbs during the crux and managed to rip out 2 pieces of gear, one came out because the rock exploded. Fortunately he had been placing many pieces of good gear before this point so only had a small fall. Other people at the crag who are in no way affiliated with ICMC faired much worse. One person managed to kick out his gear on an E2 and then almost hit the deck. While a different person fell off of the extremely run out Browns Eliminate which has gear just below half height, he inverted and hit the floor. The guy’s helmet took the impact and was destroyed, but this took all of the force and he was fine. A number of other groups set up top ropes of classic climbs and then dogged up them polishing the holds a little more.\nIt was decided that once the sun started to set it was probably time to leave the crag. After packing up and picking up everybody else’s litter people headed back to the bus. Older members had head torches as they knew that we never leave the crag until it’s too dark to see and they helped everybody else back to the bus. Returning to the village hall dinner was started, learning from last year it was cooked in several small batches. A few beers were had by most people and silly antics ensued. Joel and Murray decided to play a game involving a rope, they both ended up half naked with Joel using his thighs to squeeze Murray’s head so his sock could be removed. Eventually people headed to bed.\nDay 2 – Stannage Edge Again Joel and Stefan got up early to cook breakfast for everyone. More issues ensued with the eggs as it became apparent that some of the eggs were a bit more red than might be expected, after being reminded that eggs are essentially chicken periods everyone decided to eat them anyway. Packing up everyone’s stuff and leaving the hall was also a speedy affair meaning that we got to the crag very early. People ran off to do different things all along Stannage. As a regular club place to visit many people had projects and climbs on their tick lists that they wanted to get done. There was a lot more easy bouldering than the previous day so many of the freshers had a go at that.\nAli and Murray spent a while trying to do Deliverance, Ali had spent many a day falling off the impressive dyno and spent much of this day doing the same. Lizzie climbed both the left and right unconquerables (E1 and HVS respectively), Murray wanted to climb these as well but pulled a tendon in his elbow so decided not to. Ben crushed some E2 climbs and many other routes were done by people. The day was a bit warm for particularly hard climbs as the friction gets worse with heat.\nMartin had a minor accident while bouldering, he jumped off a climb but there was a small rock under the bouldering pad which resulted in a twisted ankle. First aid was given and this opportunity was taken to crack out the ICMC SAM splints which made the injury look much more severe than it was. Murray gave his professional diagnosis of “defiantly not broken” which will hopefully break his 100% rate of incorrect diagnosis. Martin was helped home by Amy and the two of them were given places in the car so that they could get back to London earlier and be dropped home to avoid any need to walk.\nJoel started getting everyone to pack up and head to the bus at 4 o’clock. This was considered very early by a number of older members, particularly 3 ex-presidents and Fresher who decided to stage a mutiny. Unfortunately 3 out of the 4 people on the mutiny were not taking the buses back to London so noting really happened as a result of this. There was some considerable debate amongst members as to which bus they wanted to go home in and with which drivers. Eventually the unpopular driver was put in the unpopular bus and filled with people who were unaware of the reasons for them being unpopular; fortunately no incidents occurred on the way home.\nOn the journey home each bus stopped at the Pizza place in Loughborough arriving just as the previous bus was finishing so the pizza place was not totally overwhelmed. During the journey home BBC Radio 1’s Sunday Surgery was put on to entertain the drivers with other people’s misfortune. The surgery was rather boring with people mostly complaining about their weight. The final person to call up was called Mr Baggins-Mendes had a slightly more interesting story about a gay friend who kept hitting on him. Mr Baggins-Mendes kept refusing the other gentleman’s advances on the pretence that he was straight however he secretly has feelings for the gentleman but is unsure about coming out. The Surgery suggested that Me Baggins-Mendes bite the bullet and go for it however he remained unconvinced.\nThe buses arrived back at the union outrageously early and managed to unpack and get everything away in time for people to catch the tube home, a rare occasion for an ICMC trip. Overall everyone seemed to enjoy the trip with many people climbing outside for their first time and several others doing their best climbing ever. No freshers were recorded missing which is yet another impressive achievement for the new president.\n","date":"2012-10-12T00:00:00Z","image":"YAYAYA/YAYAYA/YAYAYA/p/freshers-trip-2012/images/0_hu_d51e76d491205fa1.png","permalink":"YAYAYA/p/freshers-trip-2012/","title":"Fresher's trip 2012"},{"content":"By Kip\nJourney and first night The journey started with Joel directing us to Derby via the M1. Unfortunately this is not on the way to North Wales and an hour or so was added to the Journey as we backtracked from Junction 3 of the M1. We arrived at the hut at 2:30AM under somewhat unsure if it had been booked or not, finding no one at the hut we went to sleep\u0026hellip;\nOnly to be awoken at 5:30AM by the group that had booked the hut who had some difficulties getting to Wales from London. We decamped downstairs for the night and set up our tents in the Garden the next morning to get out of their way. We are grateful that they let us use the kitchen/toilets and apologies for any disruption that we may have caused.\nTent in hut garden with ICMCs resident male model performing traditional club trip activities\nFirst day Despite the short and eventful sleep we set off for Ogwen early the next morning, only to come across a motorbike crash on the way. Fortunately there was a doctor and the mountain rescue team there and the best thing to do was to get out the way and resume our day of climbing.\nThe group divided in two with one part going to do multi pitch and the other to sheep pen for bouldering. Will was an enforced boulder due to turning up at North Wales with only formal shoes.\nTristan and Caroline had a fun day out on Cneifion Arete (Caroline’s first multi pitch). Joel and Kip simul climbed Hope on Idwal Slabs overtaking many groups of people and moving quickly through the 4 pitches for an early lunch on the large ledge at the top of the slabs. After that the two pitch original route on Holy tree wall was climbed from the top of the slabs. Joel lead the first VS pitch in wet and slimy conditions (on the single half rope that was used for the simul climbing) well and the trivial 2nd pitch was dispatched by kip with only one hairy moment of hand traversing far above gear to find a dry hold. Above holy tree wall lays continuation wall where Kip lead a very hairy 40m pitch of (apparently) Vdiff, Joel noted that Kip had managed to miss all the pockets and instead climbed on micro features.\nKip noted that the last (crap) gear was very far away near the top. The walk off from continuation wall is to walk left and down to meet the top of the normal Idwall slabs walk off. On the walk off a minor confrontation erupted between some people that were belaying on the path (after the short scramble to get off the slabs themselves) and Kip who managed to put his foot in it by asking why they were belaying on the path.\nA tired (not dead) Joel at the top of continuation wall\nMeanwhile Ben, Tom and the sole fresher on the trip Jo climbed the classic route Tennis shoe on Idwall Slabs. Despite been frequently held up by slower climbers they had a fun day of slab climbing. Everyone was impressed that Johan had soloed this route a few years before during the summer.\nIn bouldering news David did little groove, David and will did dog shooter. Cheehan destroyed all he touched and flashed the pinch. Jordan grabbed the 2nd assent of the pinch from our party. All the really hard problems were wet.\n2nd day The 2nd day we arose early and went to roadside boulders in the pass. Kip and Tom set out with the ambition of climbing Cenotaph Corner however after a very hairy scramble it was found to be wet. Therefore instead a pleasant two pitch VS was climbed up the corner to the left which had an interesting top lacking in protection that Tom lead. Joel and Milkins lead a HS that went a different way up the same buttress. Meanwhile and after many boulder problems were climbed by all at roadside and the other surrounding boulders. Lots of hand damage was suffered trying to hold too small holds.

After an unusually uneventful drive we arrived early at the accommodation and as such were unequipped to deal with dinner. An early search party set off in search of takeaway, unfortunately the chip shop was closed, but further trekking revealed a Tesco’s selling microwave pizzas. There was much rejoicing.\nThe next day began with Aviemore’s finest in winter safety instruction, the mighty Kevin, arriving to talk the novices through their first day in the mountains. Meanwhile, the passion wagon, plus Hamzah, had already packed camp and headed for the snow. The main party followed in hot pursuit, eventually meeting them in the bottom of the coire. Kevin promptly got the novices running about in the snow learning the gentlemen’s rules of a snowball fight, how to ice axe arrest, move on ice and snow and how to judge snow conditions incase they are dangerously yellow. Hamzah, Ruth and Fresher set off on their siege attempt of Invernookie (III) and Tom, Ben and Kip began what they believed to be Fingers Ridge (IV) but after Ben spent 2 hours leading a pitch by the seat of his pants it became evident that this was in fact not the case. After a quick reconsideration, the group bravely ran away, away to Red Gully (III) on the right before the ground steepened and became a crux pitch of what turned out to Fingers Ridge Direct (VII). The main party reconvened at the car park and headed home to construct a dish resembling a pasta carbonara and were eventually joined by the Invernookie team. There was much rejoicing.\nOn the second day, Kevin was met at the car park and the novices set off to do their first route, Aladdin’s Couloir (I) and much fun was had. Tom, Ben and Kip set off to try Aladdin’s mirror direct (IV), with Tom dispatching the crux ice pitch in his standard visually pleasing manor. Team snow hole +1 went to do the Runnel (II) and, after Hamzah pretended to be a sledge for a bit, abseiled back down and responsibly had Hamzah checked over by a mechanic to have the dents beaten out. After it was made apparent that all was well, chili was consumed by all, and there was much rejoicing.\nHaving completed their instruction, it was time for the novices to shed the surly bonds of snow and get on the rock. After a pre dawn walk in and it becoming apparent that John and Knut are in fact powered by uranium, Tom and Ben bravely lead two novices each (Knut, Jo, Joel and John) up Hidden Chimney (III). This was a successful venture with both teams topping out at around midday. These were soon joined by Kip and Tim (whose name is Tim) who had successfully lead the Runnel (II) and retrieved the gear and axes left by the previous days tobogganing. As the weather was so glorious, and the day was but young, an assent of Cairngorm was devised. Pairs geared up and battled up the tough 40º incline. Once summited people became happy, then naked, then happy. Fresher, Hamzah and Ruth had a rest day. There was much rejoicing.\nWinter skipped spring and summer and became autumn and conditions become unclimbable. A team of elite connoisseurs ventured to the Tomatin distillery car park, and eventually visitor’s centre. Once all the available knowledge and whisky had been absorbed a historically accurate roast dinner of biblical proportion was made and consumed followed by enough pudding to fill an ant the size of a house. There was much rejoicing.\nAs the weather was still awful, a trip to Newtyle Quarry was commissioned. After some dry tooling and the invention of the crampon smear and running man techniques, it was determined that the weather was indeed awful. The trip bravely ran away, away to the pub. After some cracking nosh and a pint or two the trip reconvened back at the house. A game of hide and seek later and diner was ready. People became hungry, then happy, then full. The following events that followed were a bit too much like fun to be mentioned in a Scottish winter report, needless to say that several ventured to Aviemore’s finest after dinner amusement, The Vault (VI). There was much rejoicing.\nFriday came and still the bad weather persisted. Some people went shopping, then some other people went shopping. Later, after hours of graft, Tim invented the snowball cocktail. Some people watched TV, someone did some work, some people talked of how they should do work. Eventually a traditional Christmas dinner of spaghetti bolognaise was eaten and it was time for the ICMC secret Santa. People became happy, then thankful, then Joel became sad. There was much rejoicing.\nOn Sunday we left. There was much rejoicing.\n","date":"2012-10-01T00:00:00Z","image":"YAYAYA/YAYAYA/YAYAYA/p/winter-tour-2012/cover_hu_785c484f5c9afcd7.png","permalink":"YAYAYA/p/winter-tour-2012/","title":"Winter tour 2012"},{"content":"Written by Michael Jones, organiser of the trip.\nOn the 25th March to 6th April 20 members of ICMC travelled to the national park Paklenica for 2 weeks of climbing! Much fun was had by all, many climbs were climbed, many cheap Croatian pizzas were eaten and a number of local delicacies devoured.\nPaklenica is famous for a river gorge lined with steep limestone cliffs up to 350m high which makes it ideal for big wall climbing. The climbing is protected by permanent bolts which made it accessible for even the more inexperienced members of the trip. The climbing experience of the members was highly variable therefore inexperienced members were partnered with two more experienced members to teach them the necessary skills to climb multipitch routes. All members experienced multipitch sport climbing on various routes. The other main activity in the area is single pitch climbing.\nThe trip ran smoothly, there was no language barrier as most locals spoke English. Nobod experienced any serious injury, all members wore helmets and had guidance on how to safely practise rope climbing. Accommodation worked out quite cheap at £10pppn and food worked out at slightly cheaper than that in the UK.\nThe tour subsidy was used to help members pay for their flights from London Stansted to Zadar in Croatia. The number of people attending the trip far exceeded that of any other tours in previous years, I thought it unfair to cap the number of people on the trip and allowed all members who were interested to attend. An application for subsidy unfortunately was aimed at a smaller group and therefore each member received less subsidy than planned.\nOther than this the trip ran smoothly. Steps were made to keep the price to a minimum, the main expenditures included: flights, transport to and from the airport (via cheap local taxis), food and entrance fee to the Paklenica national park. Most members had their own climbing gear, those that didnd\u0026rsquo;t were able to borrow gear from the club\u0026rsquo;s store room and many bought new gear for the trip.\n","date":"2012-03-25T00:00:00Z","image":"YAYAYA/YAYAYA/YAYAYA/p/easter-tour-2012/images/0_hu_f28c140519b059e3.png","permalink":"YAYAYA/p/easter-tour-2012/","title":"Easter Tour 2012"},{"content":"The full Expedition report can be found here: Expedition report\nExpedition members Jonathan Moodie Kunal Masania Dominic Southgate Jonathan Bull Virgil Scott Robin Jones Joe Prinold Anupam Murkerjee ","date":"2011-08-23T00:00:00Z","image":"YAYAYA/YAYAYA/YAYAYA/p/raru-valley-expedition-2011/images/_045_hu_67cfef355ee2ae55.png","permalink":"YAYAYA/p/raru-valley-expedition-2011/","title":"Raru Valley Expedition 2011"},{"content":"Based on a true story\n1 Introduction During the Easter break of 2011 members of Imperial College Mountaineering Club (ICMC) departed on a 14 day trip that would take them through 3 different countries in their quest for climbing. Taking the union minibus these brave adventurers drove 2276 miles through tunnels, over mountains, off road and even on the flat. Due to several members dropping out and several other members lacking just one of the requirements to be able to drive there were only two drivers of the minibus for the duration of the trip. Most of the team returned with no injuries\nThere were several aims and objectives for the tour, primary aim of the tour were to take members of the club to a number of locations and climb on a range of rock types and in styles unusual to that of the UK. Other aims were for members to improve their ability and to climb in styles that they were not so used to. The Pyrenees also offered some longer multipitch climbs that are far larger than anything available in the UK and these were the main target of some members of the tour.\nFour distinctly different rock types were seen on tour, these were limestone, sand stone, granite and conglomerate however within these broad rock types there were a range of styles from slabs to overhangs. All members felt they had improved and were stronger towards the end of the trip. Certain crags offered very interesting routes which combined different styles of climbing such as steep over hangs into technical slabs which was very rewarding to climb on. While multi pitch climbs were done by all members the attempt at Enfants de la Dalle (a 1000m+ route) was called off for concerns about the safety of the attempt. The Pyrenees mountain range has a lot to offer in the way of climbing, another tour could easily be run and not have to climb in any of the same areas. It would also be of value to return in the future and climb some of the routes that defeated the climbers this time around.\nFor future tours there are some lessons to be learnt. While taking the minibus is a reasonable way to travel it is slower and more tiring than flying. The minibus did have the major advantages of being able to take all of the equipment and did allow the tour to visit a lot more areas than would have been practical if flights had been used. The main problem was the lack of drivers, only having two drivers meant that they were very tired at the end of long stretches of driving.\nA final issue, which only became apparent after the tour was finished, was the amount of things done on tour. So much was crammed into the 14 days that an extensive tour report was required to describe the events of the tour.\n2 People The people who went on the tour were:\nMatthew Lees (Murray) Edward Stott Tristan Pollitt Jonathan Price Elliot Carrington (Choss Master) Adrian Jeakins* Michael Jones (Fails) Jonathan Mason (The American) Justine Courty* All people on the tour were full members of ICMC at the time\n*These members were not present for the entire trip\n3 Tour Diary 3.1 Day 1 – Beit While most students were finishing up for the term and moving over to the union to relax and have a few drinks before going home for Easter the ICMC members were busy packing the bus and getting ready for their 2 weeks away. Murray had spent the morning chasing various Sabbaticals and union staff for money, bus keys and tarps and had managed to get it all together in time for the bus to be packed and make a slightly delayed departure at 7 pm. Heading towards the euro tunnel took from South Kensington took the bus through central London which was packed. Eventually the motor way was reached and the lack of a 6th gear became annoyingly obvious with the engine droning away in 5 th.\nThe euro tunnel was reached in remarkably good time considering the traffic and late get away. The spare hour was used by most to wonder around the terminal but Ed took this opportunity to climb on top of the bus and have a snooze. The train was boarded just before midnight and departed on time\n3.2 Day 2 – Font Arriving in France shortly after departing and not being entirely sure of the time anymore Ed took the wheel and headed towards Fontainebleau; we arrived much earlier than expected. Since it was still dark all the members decided to find their own sleeping spots and have a good sleep before the day’s bouldering. Some members slept in the bus, some in the woods, and Ed chose the top of the bus again. The people who had chosen to sleep in the woods were woken first by the numerous dogs that went to investigate.\nAfter a good breakfast of cereal the group moved off into the forest to find the boulders they had come looking for. Murray, Ed, Fails and Choss Master set off on the purple circuit which proved to be just the right difficulty. There were some interesting problems as well as a high ball part and an impressive tunnel to crawl through. At lunch time the 4 decided to head back to base camp for food and while walking back Choss Master had a disagreement with a rock, the disagreement escalated into a fight. Choss Master decided that the best option was to head but the rock but this proved to be a bad idea. After sending someone for ice at the cafe and making Choss Master sit still for a while they continued back to base camp.\nThat afternoon Fails found an impressive looking roof section that he managed to climb after a few goes, Murray and Choss Master both climbed it afterwards. Ed and Jon both slept on top of the roof being climbed while The American did some impressive spotting for those on the roof. After everyone had climbed themselves out for the day they got back on the bus and headed for Targasonne stopping in some services for Chilli.\n3.3 Day 3 – Targasonne After some more speedy driving at 100 kph by Ed and Murray Targasonne was reached ahead of schedule and again people decided to sleep by the road instead of going straight for the climbing. Just when everyone had got to sleep it began to rain, most people dived straight into the bus but Jon and Ed had other ideas, they slipped under the bus to use it as a shelter and both slept there. A couple of hours later an angry French man turned up and told us we were in the wrong place, the bouldering was further out of town, and he told us to get out of the lay-by we were in. Seeing the rain hadn’t stopped and not wanting to get in trouble the decision was made to make a break for the border. On the way there was a rather long tunnel and the tunnel game was introduced to all (where one holds their breath while in the tunnel), unfortunately the 13 km tunnel proved far too long for anyone to finish.\nLater that day the bus rolled into their new home for the next week and set up camp, this time in the right place. On the Spanish side the weather was much more favourable with no sign of rain, not wanting to waste the rest of the day everyone jumped back into the bus and went to the closest crag that had things easier than 7a; Crestes De Conill. After getting spanked by the easiest of climbs and blaming it on being tired and on unusual rock the team returned to the campsite. Homemade burgers were on the menu that evening, after burning all of them in an effort to avoid food poisoning everyone turned in for the first good night’s sleep to be had in a couple of days.\n3.4 Day 4 – Conglomerate After waking up to surprisingly good health after dinner the night before a relaxed pace was adopted for this days climbing. The destination was an area called Collegats, quite a large area of conglomerate climbing. Most of the routs had a boulder start, easy middle and a difficult top section. The conglomerate rock had an interesting mix of hidden jugs and a lot of traps. Fails and Choss Master decided to demonstrate their punter like skills by setting up a top rope on a 6c and did not attempt the lead. Murray tried a 6a on lead but had to retreat and let fails rescue his quick draws.\nSome refreshing rain started at the end of the day making the decision to end climbing and go back to camp for everyone. Dinner that night was a tuna and tomato pasta dish.\n3.5 Day 5 – Lleida This was the first time breakfast had been porridge on the trip. The plan was to have a rest day and go into Lleida to pick up Adrian who had flown in late after needing to finish project work. In Lleida the food supplies were restocked and lunch consisted of 2 Kg of mystery meat purchased at the reasonable sum of €4. Decathlon was next on the shopping trip for people to restock on climbing equipment they had decided they needed.\nAfter a phone call from Adrian saying there was a delay and he would be getting into Lleida 2 hours later than originally planned the idea of a rest day was scrapped and the guide book was reached for. The closest climbing to Lleida was a cave with a number of routs ranging from 8a to unclimbed, deciding this was a bit hard bouldering a bit further away was chosen. After about half an hour driving on a dirt track into the desert leaving a massive dust cloud in the wake of the bus the boulders were discovered with the tell tale chalk of a long history of being climbed. A number of hard powerful problems were climbed and many remained unclimbed even after ridiculous back breaking beta was used. Once Adrian was picked up from the train station and the short journey back to camp completed dinner was put on, this time it was carbonara.\n3.6 Day 6 – Accident The destination for climbing this day was Camarossa. Being a road side crag made access very easy, luckily the road lead to a hydro electric plant and had very little traffic on it. Being at the bottom of a valley there was no direct sun for much of the day. Fails had spotted a short 6c+ that had a powerful crux, ideal for the Westway climber. After some working he eventually got it clean, attempts were made by Murray and Choss Master but were unsuccessful.\nWhile climbing elsewhere Ed took a rather large lob (4 – 5 m) whilst trying to clip a bolt. Unfortunately during the fall he inverted in the harness and hit his head on the rock below, he was not wearing a helmet at the time. At first glance the injury was quite bad; there was a lot of blood on Ed and the rock. On closer inspection while the cut was deep it was not through to the skull so it was bandaged up. Within a short period Ed was feeling much better but decided not to climb anymore that day.\nFurther up the road from the crag was an interesting looking cave which had a couple of inches of water in the bottom. The cave was large enough for a car to drive down and the tell tale tyre marks at the entrance confirmed this had been done. The cave extended about 100 m into the rock, made a turn and ended. It was concluded that this was a secret government facility with a concealed entrance and we would all disappear if exploration continued. Dinner that evening was a BBQ which was enjoyed by all.\n3.7 Day 7 – Schorchio! The morning was spent in the town of Balaguer stocking up on food. While the team were shopping Fails took decided to go for a haircut. On the return from the hairdressers to the bus he managed to get lost and needed to be rescued by Ed. Fully stocked the team left the town to find some climbing.\nAfter parking next to a bee hive the team walked up to the climbs at Cubells. This was by far the hottest day of the trip. The crag was south facing and right a t the end of the foot hills, from the base of the walk in the land was flat for as far as the eye could see. While the climbing was very good the heat was exhausting and the constant bees following the climbers up the crag were annoying.\nReturning to camp a curry was cooked up and eaten in very little time. Just before going to bed some members decided to take showers, one of these members was Fails. It turned out that fails had forgotten his towel and thought that the best solution was to dance in front of the hand dryer in his boxers until fully dried. This matter was not aided by people flicking water at him.\n3.8 Day 8 – Birthday After a day of being roasted by the Spanish sun a rest day was called for. Various activities were devised by members. Revision was a popular idea but very little was achieved. Some members went on a walk around the camp site and found a chain of 65 caterpillars following each other nose to tail. Attempts to join the 2 ends of the chain together failed so they were left alone.\nLater a trip was organised into Balaguer to restock on food again. While in town the idea of ice creams was put forwards, unfortunately at a mere 32 o the local ice cream shop felt it was too cold for anyone to buy ice creams and had not opened. While wondering around town a rather unusual shop was discovered that had many sweet deals, fails was in heaven and splashed out.\nOnce all the entertainments of Balaguer were exhausted swimming in the river was suggested and all members agreed this was a perfect way to cool off, near to the camp site was a lake that looked ideal. At the entrance to the lake a small bridge crossed, at approximately 5 m high it was a good height for jumping into the river from. After extensive testing by throwing rocks of various size into the river it was deemed safe enough for Fails to jump in. Driving the minibus off the bridge and into the river was also put forwards as a more conclusive test but the barriers next to the road prevented this. After Fails jumped into the water with a small Spanish audience and survived it was then considered safe enough for the other more valuable members to enter. Murray took the longest to get over his psyche problem but did jump in the end. The water was very cold and quick exits were made by all.\nAfter some issues with the stoves catching fire due to leaky petrol canisters chilli was served but, rather unusually for ICMC, there was also a desert on offer. The desert was a quadruple chocolate cake hand crafted for The American’s birthday. It consisted of 2 chocolate sponges glued together with melted chocolate, covered in more melted chocolate, with chocolate eggs on top each with a soft chocolate centre. Candles were fashioned from the left over cheese wax wrapped around sticks and soaked in petrol.\n3.9 Day 9 – Policía This was to be the last day spent in Spain. The tent was packed up with impressive speed and everything was ready to go so fast that the reception was not yet open. After waiting for reception to open and paying for the camp site ICMC was on the road again. Heading north towards France they stopped to check out Pachamama, Chris Sharma’s famous 9a+, all were amazed at the size of it and how over hanging it was. While having lunch it was realised that more people had been to the moon than had climbed that piece of rock. With that sobering thought they got back on the road.\nThe crag for the day was located on an abandoned stretch of highway that was left to crumble after the new highway was constructed that tunnelled straight through the rock rather than winding around the valley. The abandoned highway could easily be from a scene in a post apocalyptic film and as such everyone was on guard for zombies or gangs who might want our supplies. The walk up to the crag was steep and had a lot of loose rock, once at the top everyone immediately found a bush to hide behind as the sun was beating down again. Finishing climbing early as there was still a lot of driving to do that day they got back on the road and played the tunnel game, again being defeated by the 13 km monster.\nWhile on the road heading towards France the bus was waved over by the policía, they asked for the drivers licence and there seemed to be some problem with it not being valid for the type of vehicle being driven. Trying to explain it only had 9 seats so was not category D failed due to the language barrier. One of the policía seemed interested in what we had on the room and after shouts of “escalada” their attitude changed and they waved us on. Deciding that they would not hang around long enough for the policía to change their mind they made a break for the border. There was an interesting detour from the main road that the sat-nav seemed to think was better, while being a lot more picturesque it was unclear if it was any faster. Arriving at the very cheap camping municipal after a long hill climb in the bus the team settled down for what might be a rather cold night due to the altitude.\n3.10 Day 10 – La Dent d’Orlu Waking up to a surprisingly warm morning considering the altitude the first views of the new scenery were seen and impressed all. There was still snow on top of many of the mountains and the ski lift was running. The plan for the day was to check out a mountain called La Dent d’Orlu, on the south and east faces were many multi pitch climbs, one of which was of particular interest: Les Enfants de la Dalle. This rout had been chosen by Murray and Jon as their main target for the tour, the total height was 1100 m of rock made of 28 pitches all needing to be done in 1 day. Today was going to be a reconnaissance trip in order to climb some smaller routes and work out where then needed to be for the main ascent.\nThe town of Aux les Thermes was called at for fuel and food before heading to Orlu to find the mountain. Parking in a large car park at the bottom the first views of the climb were intimidating to say the least. A huge face of dark stone that looked much higher and steeper than expected with the top few hundred meters capped in snow greeted the climbers and they had not even done the walk in yet. The topo suggested a 30 minute walk in but this was more like an hour and 30 up steep woodland with a difficult to follow path. Reaching the bottom of the climbs a well deserved lunch was had. Part way through lunch a rock landed a couple of meters away from the happy picnickers, from the sound it was estimated to be going very fast and about toaster size. Helmets were donned by all who had them and the guide book was placed over the head of the one member who had left theirs behind.\nWhile scoping out routs, rain drops could be felt and the weather looked like it might be about to take a turn for the worse. Large seepage patches could be seen and few bolts could. The decision was made to abandon climbing here as it was unsuitable for teaching multipitch and would have been potentially dangerous even for the experienced climbers. The walk out was no better than the walk in and would have been near impossible if the sky had opened.\nA crag much closer to the camp site was located with a good selection of climbs and even some multipitch. It turned out to be an interesting mix of some technical slab and powerful overhangs and was very enjoyable. Fails and Choss Master climbed a 6c, when Murray attempted it he slid down the slab section losing some fingertips. Jon and Murray climbed a multipitch and had a difficult conversation half way up, they decided that it was not a good idea to climb Enfants as it would be too dangerous and getting benighted was a certainty.\nReturning to camp after an exhausting day of walking up hills everyone was in the mood for a less strenuous day the next day so bouldering was again on the table. Dinner was carbonara.\n3.11 Day 11 – The Mountain Pass Deciding to take an easy day after all the fell wondering the day before a group decision was made to do some hard bouldering Targasonne. Realising that it was on the other side of the 13 km an alternate route was looked for to avoid the toll, a mountain pass over the tunnel was found which was open so this became the new route, the sat nav objected heavily. Driving up the zig zagging roads was reasonably fun until the bus entered fog that was as thick as pea soup, then the drivers realised they had made an amazing decision and the trip was to be a lot more fun. After some time of driving with about 15 m visibility the bus suddenly left the fog into the sunny clear air on the other side of the mountain, turning a corner the team got a view of what they had just driven out of. It looked rather like someone had dropped a large amount of dry ice on France and the smoke was pouring through the cull.\nArriving at Targasonne and not having a guide book meant finding the climbing was rather difficult, driving along the road many small boulders were pointed out until rounding a corner a gigantic boulder field appeared and it was obvious where they were meant to go. Parking in a road version of an oxbow lake, the bus was unloaded and everyone headed off in the direction of the closest boulders. The plan was to wonder around and find cool looking problems to try and not worry about grades or what was possible, a plan which proved to be excellent. The first big boulder that base camp was set up at had a number of problems on which were all enjoyable. The top out appeared flat when climbing but long chalk streamers ran down the top of the rock that guided the hands to hidden jugs. People wondered around for a while each picking out their own rocks of interest. Fails and Adrian found an impressive problem that they spent most of the day working requiring difficult moves into under cuts and a top out that was not particularly friendly. After many attempts and almost at the end of the day Adrian almost made an ascent but failed at the final move when he tried to pull onto the top but found there were only prickly bushes, making a dynamic retreat all the observers saw his grazed torso caused by the top out. Inspired by this effort fails put a tee-shirt on and managed to top out the problem grading it V6+ or V7. Several other problems were climbed and not climbed and overall everyone had a very good day.\nThe sharp granite had taken its toll and everyone’s fingertips were feeling very thin. The journey back involved driving back through the fog again which was no thinner. Dinner that night was another BBQ. Some members decided to eat in to the next day’s lunch rations and cook some bananas with chocolate.\n3.12 Day 12 – Choss Looking through the guide book for some multipitch climbs that everyone could do the location Sinsat 1, Le Pubis, sector GR4B+ was chosen. Upon arriving the discovery was made that the climbs were half way up a mountain, the long walk in the baking sub began. While walking up the foot path it was noted that a number of the climbs on different walls could be linked to make a multipitch ascent which was much longer than the guide book had first indicated, some French climbers were doing this. The topo used for the Foix area was printed from the internet, if pictures had been included it would have been easier to identify the crags and it may have been noticed that the various climbs could be linked up sooner. The climbs were good quality with little polish. This was some member’s first experience of the slightly sparse nature of multipitch bolting.\nWhile climbing Fails and Ed reached the top anchor first, this anchor was shared between two routs and Murray and Jon were on the other route. While Murray and Jon had set off first, Fails and Ed had the advantage of one less pitch. Murray and Jon’s route finished with a good jamming crack that would have been a quality trad lead. With the French climbers closing in from the bottom Murray had to unclip some of Fail’s quick draws after Fails was safely on the anchor and build his own as there was not enough space on the existing one. The top out was covered in choss, some of which was knocked down by almost everyone.\nAfter the first set of groups topped out they began their walk down so that they could rest and prepare for the next climb. The second set of climbers topped out and descended without trouble. This left the Choss Master and the American as the last group to finish the climb. The Choss Master had earned his\nname previously by knocking off vast quantities of choss onto his b-layers all trip, and this climb was no exception. Using the radios to warn of the large quantities of choss descending the cliff allowed everyone time to run for cover, after the first load helmets were replaced. During the descent the two climbers took a wrong turn, after some time the other members became concerned about their absence. They were on the far side of a ridge, so radio contact was useless. After some time radio contact was re-established by walking to the top of the ridge and all was well.\nThe decision was made back at camp to travel back to Font that evening so as to have more bouldering time. A curry was cooked up by fails and the tent packed in record time and ICMC were on the road again.\n3.13 Day 13 – Loughborough Arriving at Font very early in the morning a few hours sleep were had in the forest again. Another member of ICMC would be joining for just the 1 day of climbing; Justine who lived in Paris got the train to join us. Numerous problems were climbed including one with many monos in it, finding the monos difficult to hold Murray climbed it without the m. A slab next to base camp was found and it had few holds, a few finger nail crimps and smears, it was alto slightly slimy. Attempts were made by most people who all slid down its face. Murray used the incredible friction of his stealth onyx rubber to climb it using the crimps and later eliminated these as well proving once again that 5.10 make the best rubber.\nGoing to a real campsite this time ICMC met Loughborough university mountaineering club. It turned out that they were on their annual trip to font for 10 days. They were all very impressed by our big red bus and were even more amazed after they found out what we had been doing for the last two weeks. Some members of Loughborough had slack lines and were very skilled at it, one member having a 100 m long one at home. The evening was spent sitting around the camp fire exchanging stories eating chilli with a slightly soapy taste.\n3.14 Day 14 – Blood, Sweat and Washing up Liquid Having a lazy start to the day everyone stayed in bed for a while before getting up and showering. While preparing breakfast washing up liquid was found all over one of the boxes and needed cleaning out, this explained the interesting flavour in the previous nights meal, on the positive side the cooking box was the cleanest it had been since it was new. The tent was packed up one last time and farewells were said to the Loughborough climbers.\nTravelling to a different area of Font this day. Jon was feeling very ill so spent most of the day asleep. A blue circuit was attempted but it was poorly sign posted so was abandoned. Murray found an even bigger, steeper smoother slab to climb which took him quite a long time to work but he got it in the end. A large overhanging bulge was found by Fails and Adrian who worked out beta and climbed it, other members tried and Murray managed it after many goes. While driving back to a different car park to have dinner Murray had a random nose bleed while driving so pulled over and let Ed finish. The last supper was carbonara and everyone was full to bursting after eating it.\nSetting off on the drive back to England the decision was made to avoid the toll roads since there was so much spare time before the train left. Most of the drive back was on minor roads and through villages, this didn’t have much impact as the speed limits were all 100 kph so the bus was maxed out anyway. Arriving at the terminal 4 hours early the bus was upgraded for free onto a much earlier train so that they arrived back into the UK in god time. Arriving at the union shortly after dawn the bus was unpacked and all the equipment dumped into stores to be sorted at a later date. Keys, first aid kit and minibus documentation returned to the SAC, all the members went their separate ways to get a proper sleep in a bed.\n4 Finances 4.1 Income Item Price (£) Quantity\nFull price ticket 225 7 Cheap ticket* 175 1 Union Grant 129.54 1 IC Trust 238.93 1 Total = £2108. *Adrian flew in 4 days late so didn’t pay full price\n4.2 Expenditure Item Cost (£)\nMinibus 592 Fuel 560 Guide Books 56 Camping 365 Euro Tunnel 116 Road Tolls 100 Food 420 Total =£ 2209 ","date":"2011-03-25T00:00:00Z","image":"YAYAYA/YAYAYA/YAYAYA/p/easter-tour-2011/cover_hu_51ccaa2777fff6fd.jpg","permalink":"YAYAYA/p/easter-tour-2011/","title":"Easter Tour 2011"},{"content":"Introduction 10 members of Imperial College Mountaineering Club travelled to the sunny island of Mallorca from the 12th to the 25th September. Not for the cheap thrills of Shagaluf but for the vast amounts of climbing on offer. While on tour many different areas were visited with all sorts of climbing on offer from caves to slabs. Some members achieved very highly whereas others had a less fortunate time. The aims and objectives of the tour were for members to climb in a different environment to those that they are used to.\nIn Mallorca the climbing was all sport or deep water soloing which are less common in the UK. There were also some longer multi pitch routs that members enjoyed climbing. Due to unforeseen circumstances 2 members had to use their recently acquired advanced first aid skills to help one team member out.\nOverall Mallorca was an excellent location to visit. There was a wide range of grades from very easy to very hard. A lot of the very interesting routs were harder than many members could climb. Despite being a relatively small island there was a significant amount of driving. We managed to take advantage of cheap villas due to the off peak season and found some cheap car rental places, food was also remarkably low cost. We all learnt the hard way that accidents can happen, even when not doing a particularly difficult climb and we must always be aware of hazards.\nTop Row: Ruth, Jon, Ali, Lisa, Ollie, Elliot, Murray. Bottom Row: Tristan, Abi, Fails\nPeople The people going on the tour were:\nMatthew Lees (Murray) - President Mike Jones (Fails) – Vice President Jonathan Price Alastair Brash Lisa Alhadeff Elliot Carrington Tristan Pollitt Ruth Lawson Abi Attrell Oliver Mower Diary Day 1 – Flight With 10 members flying from all over the country to Palma it was quite remarkable that all but one person had met in the country just after noon. The one member who had decided to take a later flight for a sweet deal wouldn’t arrive until much later that night and cause much unnecessary driving, the fuel for which probably cancelled out his own saving. Picking up the cars turned out to be not as simple as expected, the rental firm was too cheap to buy a place in the airport and needed a bus to get there. The cars however were very cheap and were already scratched and dented, as a bonus hey came with free insurance meaning we wouldn’t get fined for bumping the car. Driving out of Palma proved to be difficult but after a scenic drive around the city the motorway was found and the other side of the island quickly reached. Arriving at the accommodation Ali was convinced that the lead diver Murray was completely lost but was surprised when it turned out that they had arrived at their accommodation. The villa was perfect for the club needs and was very cheap. Classic ICMC Chilli was had for dinner.\nDay 2 – El Fumat The first crag to be visited on the trip was thought to be a local crag called El Fumat, but turned out to be the other side of a mountain so there was some slow uphill diving. The crag had excellent views and was well bolted. Most members found the grades to be hard; this was probably due to the new location and tiredness. On the menu for dinner was Curry.\nDay 3 – Les Perxes The area chosen today had a couple of different crags. Most of the group went to the easier section near the car park called Hairpin but Ali and Lisa decided to go for the cave nearby. The easy crag got sun around 2 and became too hot for climbing, the cave being north facing remained cool all day. Some members decided to go watch the cave climbing and take photos but others went to the higher crag that had a little bit more shade. Ali managed to climb an impressive climb up with some good tufa action and a nice rest in the middle. One of the local climbers then crushed it while warming up for a much harder climb. Carbonara was on the table tonight, there was much debate over what the ingredients should be.\nDay 4 – Deep Water Solo Being the tour’s first venture into DWS an easy small crag was chosen. There were 3 routs on the smallest section; the 6a was enjoyable and easy and done by most. The water was very clear and we could easily see that the bottom was a long way down There was a good 7a with a cool dino in the middle which many people fell off. Some members quickly decided they didn’t like DWS and others needed to work on jumping off to get over a fear of height. Some members had no problem jumping off the cliffs but had some minor issues entering the water. At the top of the cliff there was a mast, probably used for sailing the island to new locations, where we left all of our food and bags. Ali, Ruth and Lisa managed to hit their heads on the mast; unfortunately since they were not climbing at this point in time they didn’t have helmets on, all 3 felt very silly. A DWS dinghy was bought to help get people to the bottom of the climbs and to rescue them in case something went wrong. Various names were put forward, there were: Lizzie Wilkins, Fun Splash, Enema, Ella and Emma. After some debate the name Ella stuck, it was later revealed that this was also the name of Jacob Dean’s 12 year old sister, after this the innuendos came thick and fast. Fajitas were for dinner.\nDay 5 – Rest day 1 Most people slept in late this day after some early starts on the previous days. Everyone except Ali went for a walk along the coast but Ali remained behind to do a literature review. While walking a large number of naked people were seen, this was highly disturbing. An old abandoned pill box was found and explored, it was very hot inside. Finding a small cover everyone sat down and had a lovely time playing in the water. Murray kicked a rock while swimming and bled all over the place. Fails annoyed a sea anemone by destroying its home and it got its own back by stinging Fails, Elliot and Ruth. Since it was Elliot’s last night with us we had another Chilli to remind him of all the good times.\nDay 6 – Sa Gubia, eastern side Another early start to get to the crag before the sun hit it. The massive walls of Sa Gubia were on the table for today. Ali and Lisa decided to have a day alone and headed over to the steep hard world of Fraguel. After quite a long walk in up a dry river bed the bottom of the wall was reached where we met 2 local climbers who gave us a lot of tips about which crags not to visit as they had bad bolts.\nThe 2 best climbs of the day were a delicate 6a and an outrageous 6a+ which had some cool tufa action on it. Ali and Lisa also had a good day out. The group split in 2 with half heading back to make a curry for dinner and the others taking Elliot to the airport for him to head home early.\nDay 7 – DWS \u0026amp; more Sa Gubia Murray, Jon, fails, Abi and Ollie headed over to Cala Sa Nau to try out a different area. There were a number of easy climbs, fails managed a 6b but failed on the 7a. Murray tried the 7a from day 4 but ripped the tip of his finer off on the sloping crimp. Abi jumped off the top and made a big splash. Ella was launched; she was a much finer vessel than the other group who were at the crag. The climbers at Sa Gubia tried a number of different things. Tristan and Ruth had a mini adventure on their 2 pitch multi pitch. Ali and Lisa tried a few hard things with little success. Since it was a Sunday most shops were closed so there was not a lot of food to be had. Heavy rain made the road outside the apartments turn into a small river. Since it was Lisa’s last day she decided to get drunk instead of packing.\nDay 8 – Rest Day 2 Ali got up early to take Lisa to the airport, everyone else stayed in bed for quite a while. While Ali was sleeping most other people went for a large food shop taking advantage of Lidl’s cheap prices. After the shop everyone moved to the beach to enjoy the Mallorca sun. The slack line was put up and everyone had a good go with various levels of susses, this attracted many tourists who took\nphotos, if a hat had been left out we probably would have made some money. Towards the end of the day we moved the slack line to two trees that were much further apart, right at the limit of how far the slack line could reach. While tensioning the line we melted a section as there was so much force! This line was very long and wobbled a lot. Murray and Tristan both got about half way on it but nobody made it the whole length. Some people were scared off by the height of the line but the soft sand gave a good landing and when it sagged in the middle it was quite close to the floor anyway. While slack lining Fails failed and landed with one leg either side of the line and had to sit down for a while, see right.\nDay 9 – The Accident Ali and Fails headed off to a hard over hanging crag with short boulder like routs. Everyone else went to Puig St Martin where there was shade all day and easy climbs. A number of different routes were done. While trying a 5+ with a high first bolt Ollie slipped and hit the ground. He had broken his ankle and mountain rescue were called to evacuate him. Jon and Murray had both been on the union run outdoor first aid course which proved very useful. Both tried to check for broken bones but didn’t feel anything that felt broken, both were carrying first aid kits but there was little they could do. Four firemen arrived with a stretcher to carry him out, they were not particularly gentle. Everyone went to visit Ollie that evening, he was on pain killers at this point and seemed quite merry, fortunately he had BMC insurance and everything was OK.\nDay 10 – DWS Abi decided that she wanted to stay with Ollie for the day and keep him company as being in a foreign hospital. Everyone else decided to go deep water soloing as there would be nothing to hit and get hurt on. Ali and Fails went to Cala Barques and everyone else went to Santanyi. Ali and Fails found their perfect climbs of steep jug climbing with big powerful moves. The others enjoyed their day and went to visit the legendary Es Pontas and were surprised by how shallow the water was there.\nDay 11 – Les Perxes Mark II A permanent problem with Mallorca was trying to find shady crags where the heat was not too severe. Port Soller had a large amount of shade but we discovered building works and so couldn’t climb there. Returning to a previously visit crag is generally avoided on tour but this area has several sections. Ali and Fails went to the cave and tried more hard things. Everyone else went to the upper section called Muro de Caimari. There were several hard climbs done by all. Ruth and Tristan found an extremely pumpy 6b which was very hard. Ollie was visited in the evening and this time had a large amount of metal in his leg after the operation and was in for a bad night sleep. After climbing we took Fails to the airport as he had found a sweet deal and booked an earlier flight home\nDay 12 – Betlem Waking to the sound of heavy rain was not a good start to the day. Almost all the climbing locations would be soaked and the only things able to be climbed would be caves. Contrary to the malicious propaganda spread by the Outdoor Club we did not go to a pub, we went climbing instead. A crag called El Calo de Betlem was decided upon as it had some shelter and easy cave climbs. Arriving at the crag to find that rock fax lied and only a part of the routes were dry we soldiered on. Most people tried a cool looking 6b which had some hard moves in it to a hidden and now sodden slot. While Abi was on top rope an assisted dyno was attempted with no result. Another nearby area was investigated but the best routs were slabs that were still wet and there were serious signs of seepage. Murray and Ruth checked out an abandoned house which had an aloe vera plant in front that was about 3m tall and you could stand on its branches/leaves. Setting up a water line over the pool was discussed at length. We found 2 points that we felt would be suitable anchors and active spotting near the edges of the pool was also proposed. Unfortunately it was felt that the 2 anchors were too far apart and a water line was not put up. Instead a raft was built from the many empty water bottles with an impressively poor result.\nDay 13 – Home Time Ali and Abi went back to Les Perxes for Ali to try and finish his route. The top slab was wet and no route finishing happened. Packing the cars with all of our stuff took a while and lead to a rather uncomfortable trip to the airport. Both cars had to be returned empty and so the economy race was on. Murrays diesel had only had 1 ½ tanks of fuel so was already low but made it to the rental drop of shortly after the fuel light came on. Ali was forced to put in an extra 5 euros of fuel. At the airport there was a slight challenge convincing the staff that Ollie couldn’t walk and that he needed a wheel chair. After a large amount of repacking to get everyone under the weight limit we all ate and drank as much as we could to get as heavy as possible to reduce the fuel economy of the plane to restore Ryanair’s karma. Arriving late at Stansted we were all greeted by an enormous line for border control with some grumpy staff who were extremely unhelpful. We retried our bags and then all went our separate ways.\nFinances Cost Breakdown Income Value Member Income £1800 ICU Funding £410 Expenditure Value Consumable £400 Accomodation £1240 Car hire £370 Fuel £200 ","date":"2011-01-02T00:00:00Z","image":"YAYAYA/YAYAYA/YAYAYA/p/summer-tour-2011/images/0_hu_4d4ef59cbc87be98.jpg","permalink":"YAYAYA/p/summer-tour-2011/","title":"Summer Tour 2011"},{"content":"Objectives The main objective was to have fun and everyone agreed that we\u0026rsquo;d met this goal.\nAn important secondary objective of the tour was to introduce younger members of the club to winter climbing with the hope that the skills they acquired would stay in the club for years to come. As no-one sold their boots afterwards I would consider this achieved! The main difficulties of winter climbing for the club are the long drive, variable conditions and the high cost of entry. It is hoped that with the recent purchase of boots (joint with outdoor club) will remove one of the most expensive purchases that aspiring mountaineers have to make (boots are ~£300) and will increase participation in this sport.\nAttendees Jonathan Hazell Ruth Lawson James Lawson Joe Weston Ben Coope Tom Wheeler Hamzah Tour Diary Day one Getting an early start for the 14 hour bus journey to Scotland we packed up the bus in record time and set off at 10am. Our excitement reached unprecedented levels when the first flakes of snow were spotted on the M6. Unfortunately this caused a traffic jam, but we managed to avoid it with a scenic tour of Staffordshire. The trip almost ended for two of the tour\u0026rsquo;s members when they decided to save some money by buying some bread and chicken from a M\u0026amp;S at a service station. All was going well, until a comment from Ben about how the chicken was a little squishy lead to the discovery of cooking instructions, Tom had already wolfed the whole packet\u0026hellip; Fortunately all was well, and much fun was had in Glasgow’s Tescos buying food before arriving at our palace for the week.\nDay two First day of climbing for the more experienced members and the first day of winter skills course for the novices. The guide Kevin came to the palace to talk us through what we would be doing, he changed his plan from a two day winter skills course to a one day winter skills course and a day climbing an easy route. The first day we got used to walking around in the snow, wearing crampons, using iceaxes, self belays and self arrests. The day was tiring but great fun. Kevin took the novices back to the palace and we got started on food. Roast pork with potatoes and veg. Parsons and friends arrived late in the evening.\nDay Three Again the older members went to do some climbing of their own before having to supervise the novices. Kevin and the novices set off up a grade I climb, with Tom, Ben, Hamzah and Ruth getting their first winter climb! This was very valuable as Kevin was able to solo around the leaders (something that we would not be able to do as a club) showing them how to find gear placements in the snow and demonstrating winter specific belay techniques. The novices got down early again and got on with food, Roast lamb shoulder (reduced from Tesco) with rice, mash and veg. Parsons’ crew were impressed with our culinary skills\u0026hellip;perhaps we could increase them with a cooking course?\nDay Four Joe took Tom and Ben up the Slant (grade II) splitting it into three pitches to give the two novices a good chance of leading. Joe’s team topped out first due to alpine efficiency and got off the mountain in good time. James took Hamzah up the same route as Joe’s team with James leading the whole route in the recommended two pitches. Jonathan took Ruth up a slightly harder route with Jonathan leading both pitches, first route climbed with overhanging steps! (variation of Hidden Chimney) At the top the two separate parties bumped into each other and agreed to navigate off together. Conditions were sub-optimal with strong winds(gusting up to 50mph), minimal visibility and heavy snow. However, good navigational skills from Jonathan in challenging conditions got us safely off and back to the bus where Joe’s party were ready and waiting for us. Dinner was cooked by Parsons’ group chilli and there was gateaux.\nDay Five Joe, Tom and Ben wanted to try the route Jonathan and Ruth did the day before so set off early for a day on the hill whilst everyone else took a well earned rest day. Bourbons with whipped cream were eaten in abundance in the command palace. Dinner was cheesy-eggy- pasta with sausages and veg.\nDay Six “Raining at all altitudes” – were not the words we wanted to hear and looking out the window the previously picturesque white landscape had transformed to a patchy white, green and mostly brown view. For the group who had a rest day on day five this was very disappointing, but unavoidable. So we took a trip to Avimore, but didn’t have time for a trip to a distillery. The evening was spent playing hide and seek, with more obscure and precarious places found as the night progressed. Dinner was curry.\nDay seven The long drive home, with a slightly detoured route to drop Joe, James, Ruth and Ben at various locations on route. We were also able to pick up some winter boots jointly bought\nby ICMC and Outdoor Club.\nFinancial Breakdown Income: Members contributions: £150 each (£1050) IC Trust and CSB contribution: £273.\nTotal: 1323.\nExpenditure: Minibus: £414.

Sam’s mum phoned in to say the only thing on the mountains was slush. Approaching Birmingham the conspicuous absence of snow supported the poor conditions report. On arrival at the hut (1:30AM) it wasn’t even cold (~5c) the prospects of any winter climbing looked slim.\nDay 1 We all headed off to Parisella\u0026rsquo;s cave and Split Infinity for some winter bouldering. Looking quite silly attired in salopettes or in the case of one loud blonde Yorkshire man, a little authoritarian. The bouldering was good with everyone apart from Fresher completing the V3 traverse in split infinity and Rock Bottom (V6) flashed by Sam and declared “soft” by Alistair.\nDay 2 The older guys + Murray headed off to Tremadog for some trad action while everyone else headed back to the Cave. The bouldering was excellent with many of the easier cave problems climbed. Sam spent most of the day trying the high left wall traverse which looked nails; Alistair worked a problem with a silly last move. Myself Lisa and Adrian completed the end of the left wall traverse (V5) which had a very seapy polished sloper as its crux.\n","date":"2010-12-01T00:00:00Z","image":"YAYAYA/YAYAYA/YAYAYA/p/north-wales-dec-trip/images/0_hu_e5e3b254dd11024c.jpg","permalink":"YAYAYA/p/north-wales-dec-trip/","title":"North Wales Dec trip"},{"content":"By James Lawson (Kip)\nThe Journey Departure was swift, getting away from the union by 6:30pm. However due to lack of tarps we had to load all our bags/food/ropes/mats/people into the body of the bus resulting in very cramped conditions for the 7hrs journey. Food was forgotten but fortunately this had been planned for so chocolate and porridge were not significantly impacted. Again we departed quicker than outdoor (S\u0026amp;G). Our heads were full of lofty ambitions for long mountain routes; however the weather of Wales is a fickle thing…\nDay 1 The conditions were terrible with rain and hail so the decision was made for a lie in (till 10am). We then headed to Llanberis to play with gear and enquire about the possibility of dry rock. The conclusion of our meandering conversations was that only the cave would be dry. We then split into 3 groups; the first went to Parisella\u0026rsquo;s cave with the two bouldering mats, the second decided to spend the day in V12 and Joe Browns playing with shiny things and trying on B3’s and the third most awesome group decided to go for a bracing walk back to the hut. Walking over the pass was surprisingly pleasant in the hail and rain due to the awesomeness of modern technical clothing. After completing our walk I (kip) and Johan went for a pleasant swim in the frigid water of the local lake. Upon getting out of the water the previously cold air felt pleasantly warm, surprisingly no one else felt inclined to enjoy the ‘refreshing’ water. At the cave David and Fails did Rock Bottom (V6), Lisa did Pillar Finnish (V4) and Chris did Burning Sphincter (V5). People seem to be improving quite fast.\nDay 2 Holyhead Mountain was selected as our destination due to its fast drying properties. The climbs in the middle were approximately 30M on quite good friction quartz with shorter climbs on the edges, although the cracks were still wet despite it not raining the night before. I (kip) and Johan climbed Stairs a severe slab which was pleasant although friction was poor. Much to my delight it finished with a thrutch crack. About to walk off the top we heard a plaintive plea for help from Fresher who had decided to solo up an overhanging chimney in walking boots next to our slab, claiming that it “looked like a mod” from the ground. Even more amusingly he actually had climbing shoes clipped to the back of his harness. Fortunately he managed to hang around on the rock until the rescue rope reached him and avoided all injury apart from to his pride. After lunch I led an interesting looking corner crack which turned out to be Puffin Shuffle, a very fun route that was quite near my limit. Chris led Breaking the Barrier (E1). Managing another 3 routes with Kunal; good going for the limited amount of daylight. Alistair tried an E3 only to be defeated by the wetness of the cracks, although he got most of the way up. To paraphrase “I had to crimp the edges of the layback it was that wet”. In the esoteric corner Calum found some choss to play with and David found the blocks at the bottom of the mountain to be excellent bouldering. Fails and Danny did some trad leading together, climbing stairs in a single pitch and using the awesome number 7 Tricam (on loan from Johan) as belay gear.\nDak seconded Lizzie and got lured into Freshers offwidth cave. To round the day off we lost the guide book in the dark and then people who had head torches had to spend an hour looking for it, missing out on some awesome Jurassic 5 in the mini bus. The Journey Back: Quite uneventful, just long hot and uncomfortable. We stopped for tasty but greasy pizza in Bangor and observed a 4x4 with a tree stuck in it. Big thanks to Fresher and Kunal for driving for so long under such bad conditions. Overall I think we all had fun despite the conditions and long journey.\n","date":"2010-10-15T00:00:00Z","permalink":"YAYAYA/p/north-wales-trip/","title":"North Wales trip"},{"content":"By James Lawson (kip)\nThe Journey Departure from the union was as swift as could be expected from over 40 people; two mini-buses, a car and a Landrover. Shopping was completed in the previous afternoon at ASDA to save money. The metal bus most importantly departed before outdoor club’s (S\u0026amp;G) singular bus. Despite departure music mainly consisting of Tokyo Drift and Pantera and after some crazy big mini bus, small gap action onward progress was thwarted on the M1 due to a fatal motorbike accident. Fortunately we were not involved in this so after a mere 4hr delay the speedy 62mph limited metal bus continued to tear it down the motorway. We arrived at the hall in Middleton at 3AM which considerably impacted on the psyche for any fun that night and we quickly went to sleep.\nDay 1 We headed for Lawrencefield/Millstone and the boulders to secret garden, along the way we asked for directions and played some more metal. At Lawrencefield Eliot jumped on Austin’s Variation (VS) and promptly took a \u0026gt;5M lob narrowly missing a ledge. Meanwhile the fresher’s had good safe fun seconding routes from VDiff to HVS. Johnny tried Billy Whizz (E2) and fell off a few times on the crux. Lisa tried Suspense (E2) and fell off, doing it in the end. Kip tried Meringue (HVS) until realizing just how little gear there was. The Boulders by all accounts had a fun time at Secret Garden and Cheehan did a V6, V7 and V9. At Millstone Fresher taught Kip and Dak to Jam (thanks Fresher). Fresher Got his big cam stuck in Crewcut for a while in his enthusiasm to practice offwidth technique. Others climbed big stuff at millstone and all the boulders got stuck into Technical Master, Chi and Danny finishing it quite easily. Lisa did embankment 3. Alistair did Great North Road in the dark and rain by head torch; he described it as “good”. After climbing we headed back to the hut for chili and the sock game. The metal bus, cementing its position as the cool bus stopped off for reduced bakery products. After a few hours of crazy sock wrestling with only minor injuries sustained we headed for bed.\nDay 2 After cooked breakfast we headed to Stanage. “V8 “fresher did Deliverance without too much effort; also Joe Prinold also did Deliverance (V8). Alistair, Chi and Joe did Greens Traverse (V6). Johan did an E that was defiantly E1. Kip did his first HVS lead after some failed attempts due to difficulties with the Giant number 6 Cam that had to be shuffled up. It was Corner Crack a charming offwidth thrutchy thing which was quite enjoyable after half height. Fresher lead the well named Mangler (E1 5c) another offwidth chimney thing, he liked it, also it was hard. Some fresher’s were taught to lead/lead belay on a Diff by Lisa and Kip. Other Fresher’s seconded Sarah and learnt to lead belay. The fresher’s that learnt to lead commented on how much fun it was. Johan encountered a strange fellow desperately looking to complain about us/university groups in general on the internet; fortunately no one cares about things said on the internet. The Journey back was uneventful apart from awesome 2 for £8.50 pizzas in Loughborough.\nSummary The weather was great, the climbing was awesome and the pizza was tasty. Despite the traffic Jam tiredness the fresher’s trip was very fun. Everyone who is considering going on the Fresher’s trip next year should, it’s unlikely you won’t enjoy yourself. A small note for future trips is to not attempt to drop people off from the bus as London has a horrible one way system that will cause it to take about 3hrs and it’s faster for everyone to walk.\n","date":"2010-10-01T00:00:00Z","image":"YAYAYA/YAYAYA/YAYAYA/p/freshers-trip-2010/images/0_hu_7275028adafdb49b.jpg","permalink":"YAYAYA/p/freshers-trip-2010/","title":"Fresher's trip 2010"},{"content":"By: Ali\n14/10/2011 Work begins to get the first ever ICMC three minibus trip going in the morning with Joel, Kip, Murray and others completing an epic food shop. By around 4pm minibuses are in position outside Beit apart from bus 3 which turns out to be lacking a roof rack. Cue a quick cycling mission for Ali \u0026amp; Dan to go get a new bus from Charing Cross. Well, the cycling part was quick anyway. On the upside, by the time they make it back, the other buses are loaded and soon 3 buses and a car are heading north before 7pm, go efficiency!\nAfter the usual arguments about routes out of London and phonecalls en-route to try and determine who’s “winning”, all the buses make it to the hall by 11:30, Ed Stott’s car scoring an unsurprising victory owing to lack of speed limiter. Lisa is picked up from Cromford train station by Ed. Turns out that the key for the hall is not where it’s supposed to be, thankfully access is temporarily gained by other means. The key eventually arrives, beer is drunk, sleeping arrangements are sorted and everyone beds down ready for an early start. There is a minor diplomatic incident when older members discover that the club’s new overlords have removed bacon \u0026amp; sausage from breakfast in the name of austerity. Forget bank bailouts, this is the front line of the recession right here.\n15/10/2011 Porridge time comes all too soon. It’s lacking in bacon. Egg is abandoned in the name of efficiency. On the upside, the buses leave in record time owing to lack of the faff of doing a fry-up for 50. Fresher nearly causes a bus-on-bus accident with an outrageous roundabout wrong-lane overtaking manoeuvre. Ali scores a moral victory by not taking the trap turning for Froggatt and getting there first. After a bit of a wait for the third bus, everyone reunites at the crag carpark, including Andy and Lizzie who join us at the crag.\nBen on Tody\u0026rsquo;s Wall (HVS 5a)\nThose wanting to climb routes were quickly split into groups of 3 with one novice climber per. group whilst the boulderers set off to explore. On the bouldering front, Ape Drape (6c+) and Jet Pack (7b / Tom Coyne 6c+) saw many ascents and quite a few new climbers discovered the joys of Tody’s playground.\nOn the trad front Tody’s wall (HVS 5a) sees lots of action with Lizzie, Ben, Joe and Murray all leading it. Great effort from Lizzie \u0026amp; Joe in particular as it’s a tricky one for shorter climbers! It was also Joe’s first HVS! Ali remembered how to place gear again eventually on a shaky ascent of the brilliant Brightside (E2 5c). Ben and Tom went on to make short work of Valkyrie (HVS 5a), Three Pebble Slab (E1 5a) \u0026amp; The Big Crack (E2 5b), surely the hardest trad climbed by Freshers on a Freshers’ trip!\nMeanwhile, the new climbers were getting a feel for climbing on grit and gear placement by seconding older members. After some teaching in how to place gear, lots of first leads were done with Gamma (VDiff), Slab Recess (Diff), Trapeze (VDiff) and many others all seeing plenty of attention. I didn’t get to see everyone who did their first leads but well played to Jack and Joel who I did see lead for the first time. Great to see so many people taking their first steps into the world of trad climbing and loving every minute.\nMeanwhile, most of the boulderers headed along to Curbar to sample the classic delights of the Trackside boulder \u0026amp; the Guerrilla Warfare block. Not sure what got done but everyone was pretty tired by this point. Finally, Tom \u0026amp; Ali managed to scrape a couple of pads together for a ground-up solo of Oedipus Ring Your Mother (E4 6a). After a few test-jumps from higher and higher followed by a prompt schooling by a local, both were successful. Respect goes to Tom for dynoing the penultimate move with feet probably 6 meters from the deck. Ali lanked it but then got his comeuppance taking a pretty massive fall onto the pads whilst down-climbing back down the route! As the sun went down, there was a bit more action on Three Pebble Slab (E1 5a). Johan had a successful lead after a little trepidation, sadly Ruth (kicked her gear out) and Lisa (soloing!) were not so successful and ended up being thrown top-ropes.\nTom on Valkyrie (HVS 5a)\nPit bouldering on Tody\u0026rsquo;s Playground\nBack at the hut the evening’s fun and games began (Fresher making an essential beer refuelling run on the way home). Ruth overcame intoxication in order to rig up the sock game which proved to be a big hit as usual. As usual, there were no real winners thanks to the winner stays on format but suffice to say almost everyone tasted the sweet bag wine of failure at some point that night. Murray then decided to try out bouldering mat sumo which turned out to be entertaining hazardous.\nMurray promptly proves this statement by injuring his finger during the game. Chilli eventually arrives (no small task for 50) and is enjoyed by all. Sam turns up at around midnight from York!\nThe legendary sock game!\nOne of the many batches of cili required to feed 50 (thanks Luca!)\nLisa getting the goold hold post-crux on Crescent Arete (5+)\n16/10/2011 Day breaks and it’s time for Stanage, the biggest crag in the Peak District. There’s egg and porridge for breakfast this time but thankfully not at the same time. Everyone packs up and cleans the hall surprisingly quickly and we’re underway in no time. On the drive, fog around the edge causes alarm but thankfully upon arrival, the crag is dry. Lots of people bouldering this time, everyone enjoying the quality across all the grades that Stanage Plantation offers. Green traverse (7a) sees lots of attention as usual. It also sees a lot of frustrating falls right from the end as ever! A big group gets stuck into the terrifying delights of Crescent Arete (5+ but HIGH!) with Tom, Ali, Lisa and Dave all topping out with only minor psychological scarring!\nContinuing the highball theme the tall Not To Be Taken Away (6c) is up next with Tom, Cheehan \u0026amp; Ali all topping it out. Cheehan goes on to have a very good day indeed ticking Brad Pitt (7c), Captain Hook (7b) and Zippy’s Traverse (7a+). In fact most boulders in the plantation have an in-situ ICMC group on them with everyone seeming to have a good time.\nAmongst those trad climbing, Joe manages to have a particularly good day with ascents of the classic Goliath’s Groove (HVS 5a) and Millsom’s Minion (E1 5b – Joe’s first E1). After the success of his first lead at Froggatt, Jack has less luck on a VDiff at Stanage when he discovers that the finish of the route is through a hole smaller than he is! Johan does a good looking E1 (can’t remember the name, sorry) and Fresher gets stuck in some horrible wide cracks like usual.\nJoe getting stuck into Millsom\u0026rsquo;s Minion (E1 5b)\nAli on Not to be Taken Away (6c)\nCheehan on Brad Pitt (7c)\nNadia bouldering at Stanage Plantation\nAfter the traditional benightment (finishing climbing in the dark) courtesy of Luca \u0026amp; Tristan it’s time to begin the long journey home. Even longer for Sam who is dropped off to get a train back to North Wales – mental! After a couple of hours (and one navigator who seems REALLY keen to go to Derby rather than the M1) the busses arrive in Loughbrough for the traditional pizza stop. Many Meat Junctions are consumed and drivers are topped up on caffeine. Sometime around 1am the buses return to Beit Quad, gear goes back in stores and everyone heads home, tired but hopefully as happy as I was!\nThanks to everyone who came on the trip for making it one of the best we’ve had. Thanks to the photographers (Pedro, Ed, Jeffrey \u0026amp; Murray) for all the great pictures. Finally, big thanks to all of the committee who selflessly give up a lot of their time to make trips like this possible.\nI hope to see all of you soon on another of our trips!\n","date":"2010-10-01T00:00:00Z","image":"YAYAYA/YAYAYA/YAYAYA/p/freshers-trip-2011/images/0_hu_205ac226c2dd3030.jpg","permalink":"YAYAYA/p/freshers-trip-2011/","title":"Fresher's trip 2011"},{"content":" ","date":"2010-10-01T00:00:00Z","image":"/YAYAYA/images/0.jpg","permalink":"YAYAYA/p/freshers-trip-2xxx/","title":"Fresher's trip 2xxx"},{"content":"By James Lawson (Kip)\nThe Journey Due to ultra efficiency from Johan and the shopping crew the bus was ready to go at 18:05, unfortunately no one was actually here at this point, mainly due to coursework and lectures. Departure occurred some 20 minutes later. Most importantly Outdoor Club (S\u0026amp;G) where still putting bags on their roof as we burnt away from the union. The journey was uneventful apart from a slight deviation from the planned route around stoke. Eliot’s car and the bus arrived at the campsite within a few minutes of each other due to the car stopping for ice cream.\nDay 1 Fresher and I went to Jamtastic Ramshaw Rocks while everyone else went to the Roaches. I lead Phallic Crack (S) and Battle of Bulge (VS). On Battle of the Bulge I entertainingly kicked out my first gear as I moved past it and proceeded to place very suspect runners to the top. I then proceeded to be a little silly and fail to start the crank, I will return. Fresher the lead a severe crack, finding it pleasant and jammy. At the Roaches lots of teaching and fun climbing/bouldering went on.\nDay 2 The start was heavily delayed by faff and destination selection but eventually we ended up at the slightly damp Roaches. Lizze lead the crazy run out VS that Johan had lead the day before. Quite a few people got stuck into a jamming roof crack boulder problem that Fresher had found, loosing alot of skin in the process. Top knots were declared the best hair style for jamming. Murray did the hard move on ‘The Boss’ (f6c) only to fall off the easier upper moves, it was that kind of day.\nThe Race We stopped for take away in Stoke. The food varied from cheap and mostly disgusting (Ali’s) to quite good pizza with a middling price. At Ali’s a one of the local tramps decided that it was time to tell everyone which bits of London he had been too (Peckham, Wandsworth and Knightsbridge apparently). Further down the motorway we stopped for a toilet break at Harvester only to see Fellwander’s bus in the car park. Some aggressive driving and loud Tokyo Drift latter they knew that it was on. We allowed them the start and they continued to pull away from us due to an estimated 0.5Mph speed advantage on their speed limiter. However roadwork’s with average speed check and some crazy weaving and shortest path taking put us back ahead. Fellwander’s presumably knowing that we would just defeat them in London if they managed to get ahead using their speed limiter advantage bailed onto the M1 and its inevitable congestion. At the union the entertainment was provided by the door to stores been broken and therefore gear was left for the night in the bus. Even after all this faff the Fellwanders had still not got back, presumably they enjoy traffic jams.\n","date":"2010-10-01T00:00:00Z","image":"YAYAYA/YAYAYA/YAYAYA/p/roaches-2010/images/0_hu_e0f4a6fbf0abd1ed.jpg","permalink":"YAYAYA/p/roaches-2010/","title":"Roaches 2010"},{"content":"Written by James Lawson (Webmaster) \u0026amp; Alistair Brash (President)\nDay 1 (15th September): Flew out to Kos from Gatwick after a 3am start, Lizzie is woken up by a phonecall 10 mins before the Easybus leaves but somehow makes it in time. From Kos we take taxis to the port, a ferry to Kalymnos and then a bus to Massouri. Eventually we arrive late on in the afternoon at Babis bar in Massouri on Kalymnos, our accommodation for the trip. As it was getting dark when we arrived at the bar we decided to go for a swim in the pool and eat rather than attempting to climb.\nDay 2: We fafffed with gear/breakfast till 10:15 then headed out to the Poets sector, the closest to Babis bar. Kip managed to forget his shoes and attempted to Alistair’s size “too small” downturned bouldering shoes to much hilarity. Kip flashed his first 6a (after going back for shoes) and Ruth did her first sport lead (5a). Dac lead a 5a that she found “nice” called Pindaros. The bolts on “Sevasti” (7b) were found to be in silly places which was a shame as the bottom of the route involved wrestling with an incredible tufa feature. Climbing halted at mid afternoon due to climbing not been possible in the sun, we decided to wake up early the next day to climb for a greater amount of the day. At dinner that night Lizzie claimed that she could taste the fennel (despite the herbs not been fennel) and the phrase “getting involved with” was deemed acceptable.\nDay 3: Up at 5:30AM! (It was still dark) to beat the daystar at its own game. Breakfast of two eggs and bread is already getting slightly sickening. Kip took a big fall while clipping on a 6b+ and decided to sac the rest of the day off. Cheehan found a mobile phone charger and learnt how to belay. Johan found that the phrase “just bisioning around” annoyed Alistair. Ruth tried a 5b but weighted the rope due to deficiencies in route finding.\nDay 4: Lisa Beats Kip’s tour fall distance record by falling from the last move of the 40m route Trella (7a). Johan managed to climb 9 routes in a day with Dak and kip managing 8 as part of a group of 3. Alistair flashes Trella for his first 7a flash (climbed without falls on first attempt). We had lentils for tea, they were tasty.\nDay 5: Babi took the cool kids to a crag that had all day climbing due to the presence of a north face. Meanwhile red point club (Lisa, Alistair, Cheehan) had a rest day. Johan and Johnny both flashed 6c. Kip learnt how to tie in with a bowline knot which is quicker to undo than a figure 8. Dak tried a 6c for the first time.\nDay 6: Rest day for everyone who wasn’t in red point club. Red point club went and red pointed some more. Everyone else went and hired scooters and became a crazy motorbike gang for the day which involved going to the supermarket for cheap food and 1.93euro/1.5L wine and riding the mountain road to Vathy and Pothia. This was the best day of Fresher’s life. Cheehan flashes 7b+ despite having never lead outside before the trip! And Lisa almost redpoints 7a+. Kip doesn’t hold up well on the paint stripper wine (methanol content?!) and falls asleep early.\nDay 7: Fresher and Kip embarked on the first multipitch of the tour at the ‘School’ sector of Kalymnos. ‘Platon’ a five pitch route: 4c, 5a, 5b, 5c, 4b. This was Kip’s first multipitch climb but as the first two pitches were easy it was decided to simul-climb (leader and second moving together) them for speed. This was extremely fun and the first two and a half pitches were dispatched in between 5 and 10 minutes, thus showing the speed advantage this style of climbing has. As the climbing became harder and more technical towards the end of the 5b pitch they switched to belayed climbing for the end of this pitch and the following pitch with Fresher leading. The final pitch was lead by Kip with big run outs (big fall potential due to spaced protection) presumably because the first ascensionist had run out of bolts. The view from the top of the ridge line the climb went up was pretty spectacular, unfortunately for weight saving we brought no camera. The whole climb took a surprisingly brief period of time; been dispatched including abseil decent before 1:30pm!\nAlistair dispatched the route Zorba Le Gros on his 2nd attempt for his first route at the 7b grade. Lisa falls right from the end of Polipitis (7a+), plans to come back later in the trip to finish it off.\nDay 8: More climbing at Poets for most people, Alistair, Cheehan, Jonny \u0026amp; Lizzie head to the impressive cave of Spartacus where amazing routes and shade until 6pm are found. Cheehan starts work on Daniboy which at the grade of 8a is harder than any IC student in recent memory has climbed. Alistair picks the classic line of Spartacus, both routes require painfully jamming your knee in to get a hands-off rest, plans are made for one of Babis’ hand-towels to become a crucial knee-pad. Jonny tries Magnetus, a very short and powerful route at the 7c grade. Lizzie starts attempting climbs at the 6c grade. All four are enthusiastic to return another day to complete their projects. Chris \u0026amp; Lisa head back to Polipitis, get close but again not quite close enough.\nDay 9: Everyone takes a rest day, Fresher sets off determined to hire a boat. Turns out nobody on Kalymnos is stupid enough to hire Fresher a boat. Much larking around in the swimming pool happens and not a lot else.\nDay 10: Psyched after successfully imitating turbo Germans; Fresher and Kip embarked on their second multipitch climb of the tour. This time on the small island of Telendos (or Telly’d as it became known) with the objective of climbing a 6b+ overhanging “offwidth” (off width cracks are named as such because they don’t easily fit human body parts and so lead to a particularly physical form of climbing).\nFigure 7 - Telendos as seen from Kalymnos\nThe day started at noon with catching the ferry to Telendos due to the climb being north-easterly facing. Upon leaving the town on Telendos a dog started to follow us. This dog obviously used to climbers going to the closer crags giving it food proceeded to follow us over very broken terrain for over an hour and a half to our climb despite our best efforts to turn it back.\nKip lead the first 6a+ pitch of crimpy Telendos limestone which had a nice unprotected bushy muddy sloping ledge at the top. Fresher, been the expert in all things disgusting then attempted the 6b+ “offwidth” pitch which turned out to be more of a fist/hand jamming crack. The inside of the crack was made of fossilised shells that hurt a lot. After about 4hrs of pain the “offwidth” pitch was dispatched. The delay was primarily due to it been impossible to second with a backpack and having to prussic up a fixed line instead.\nFigure 8 - The notorious offwidth\nResting at the top of the 2nd pitch the decision was made to abseil off the climb due to the encroaching darkness and the “meat” of the climb having been dispatched. In the twilight at the bottom we found the dog now very dehydrated and so we shared some of our water with it.\nWhat followed was 3hrs of stumbling through the dark trying to find our way back to the town but always finding ourselves above a cliff line with an increasingly distressed dog while getting very dehydrated. Eventually unable to find a way down from the cliff line we abseiled off a sturdy bush to a low angled scree slope which lead to the shore line path to town. Unfortunately the attempts to save the dog by making a sling harness for it such that we could take it on the abseil were unsuccessful (kept wriggling out). So we feared as the dog was scrabbling around in a dangerous position (top of a loose cliff) it would die. However just as we had given the dog up as lost it came bounding down the slope towards us, obviously it knew the decent and hadn’t told us. We brought the dog back to its owner and endeavoured to explain just how lucky a dog it was.\nWhile this madness went down Johan managed 11 routes in a day on Castalia (good when each day only has 6hrs of climbing time).\nBack in the realm of the sane, Alistair successfully redpointed Spartacus for his first 7b+ route, the hand-towel taped to the knee making all the difference. Cheehan fell from near the end of Daniboy and Jonny was shot down by Magnetus but managed to climb a neighbouring 7b. Chris and Lisa both managed to redpoint Polipitis for their first 7a+ routes.\nDay 12: There were sufficient funds for all of us to have all you can eat BBQ, as a vegetarian Kip decided to spend his money on a BIG pizza instead. Certain members hit the all you can drink wine pretty hard and after a moonlit trip to the beach, are unable to find their own beds so instead settle for sharing.\nDay 13: Cheehan successfully redpointed Daniboy (8a), Johnny and Johan followed suit with Magnetus (7c) and a 7b getting redpointed respectively. All very good achievements!\nDay 14: All of us decided to have a rest day and went to Telendos where we hired sea kayaks and went to a small uninhabited island with a church on (about 2km away). We then had a tasty cheap lunch at a restaurant on Telendos. For afternoon entertainment most of us swam the 1km from Telendos to Kalymnos, for many of us our first open water swim. Fresher paddled the dinghy from the swimming pool at Babis Bar using a slippery when wet sign, a true act of heroism that required reinflation at the half-way mark. Celebratory ice-cream and beer were consumed.\nDay 15 (September 29th): Return to London via two buses, a ferry and Easyjet. Minor drama with luggage not showing up in time for Easybus, however Easybus was late so all is well. London is grey, rainy and miserable and generally inferior to Kalymnos in every respect. Still, Kalymnos has left a big impression upon all of us and we cannot wait to return in the future.\nFull List of Attendees: Alistair Brash Ruth Lawson James Lawson Lisa Alhadeff Johan Gausden Dakshina Scott Jonathan Hazell Matt Pusey Ed Stott Lizzie Wilkins Sarah Woodrow Chris Hunt Cheehan Weereratne Elliot Carrington Jonathan Bull All of the above are full-time IC students and members of ICMC. The tour budget projected 15 attendees with 14 being IC students, however the alumni member dropped out, the result was that 15 IC students attended the tour.\nFinancial Breakdown: The CSB awarded this tour £463.00 of subsidy which will be split equally between all attendees to cover travel expenditure when received. The tour broke even. There was not a fixed ticket price as not everyone came for the duration of the tour, however individual prices were calculated based on the cost of food + accommodation for the number of nights the attendees were present. The cost of the tour for a single attendee for the full two weeks once subsidy is received was £400.\nDifficulties / Objectives: The tour originally intended to run to Sardinia, however owing to a lack of eligible hire car drivers, the destination was changed to Kalymnos as it was possible to walk to the climbing from our accommodation. Changing the destination actually presented very few problems and the new destination was able to fulfil all of the tour objectives. The cost of the flights increased however this was offset by the money saved from not needing to hire cars. This also meant that our subsidy allocation was still valid, the change in destination was cleared with the DPCS well before departure.\nMany new skills were learnt from simul-climbing to new tie-in knots and even just better mental \u0026amp; physical tactics for attempting a hard route. Not a single member came away from the trip without increasing the level at which they climbed. Several members lead climbed outdoors for the first time, this is a major milestone in anyone’s personal climbing development. The well-protected and enjoyable routes played a major role in this\n","date":"2010-10-01T00:00:00Z","image":"YAYAYA/YAYAYA/YAYAYA/p/summer-tour-2010/cover_hu_97f14b510c6c5bc4.png","permalink":"YAYAYA/p/summer-tour-2010/","title":"Summer tour 2010"},{"content":"By James Lawson (Kip)\nThe Journey The journey began for some in the SAC at around 12. Due to a lack of drivers and Murray and Kips recent birthdays they were taking the minibus test on the day of the trip, if they both failed then there would be no trip! Fortunately both passed despite neither having driven a car for quite some time, kips 3 point turn and parallel parking should be noted as it’s quite hard in a minibus. Once the test was over Murray went off to do a fluids lab and then on to do the food shop with Ali. The food shop began with an email from grumpy Murray saying he didn’t want to go and ended with an amusing phone call from Kaz saying she didn’t want to go as she’d rather sleep with grumpy Murray.\nThe minibus was swiftly filled by the small number of people but departed a little less swiftly after a stall from the newly qualified driver. We arrived at Murray’s house quite early as Swanage is quite close and decided to watch top gun before going to bed.\nDay 1 Since there were quite a few freshers on this trip the decision was made to go to Dancing ledge for some easy sport and maybe some top rope climbing on the polished limestone. Calum wanted to go to Winspit as he had found an interesting M10 roof crack that he wanted to dry tool so he walked over there (about 3 miles) after we arrived. It was quite a cold day about 1-2oC so the sport climbing was difficult with most people struggling to climb anything hard. Ali found a V7 boulder problem which was a lot of fun for all to try, after working it for most of the day he finally did it with Sam getting close.\nAs the sun started to go down and everyone decided that it was getting late and we should be heading back we started to wonder where Calum was, he had been told to be back by sundown and he wasn’t. Since the place that everyone had put their stuff couldn’t be easily seen from the top of the cliff we thought Calum may have gone back to the bus so we started walking back to the bus leaving people with head torches so that signals could be sent back to the people waiting at the top of Dancing Ledge saying if he had been found or not. When we got to the bus and found Calum wasn’t there we sent the signal saying that we didn’t find him and Murray started heading back to the cliff leaving the freshers safe and warm in the bus.\nThe senior members on the trip decided to mount a search and rescue operation and decided to move fast and light. After hastily repacking bags with rescue and first aid equipment the 3 strong team of Ali, Sam and Murray ran off into the night in search of the missing member. After a 3 Km run and some difficulty navigating in the dark they arrived at Winspit and began searching the ara. Winspit is known for its quarried caves which look remarkably similar to those from Lord of the Rings, after locating the bolts for the rout Calum had been attempting and finding no trace of him or climbing equipment the decision was made to return for the bus and call the coast guard for help.\nThe coast around Swanage is notorious for lack of phone signal anywhere along its length so the coast guard couldn’t be called until we had returned to the people who had been left in the bus. As soon as the team reached an area where there was phone signal they all received a barrage of texts, voice mails and missed calls from Calum and Fresher (who had not some on the trip) asking us where we were and telling us that our missing member was. After coming back to Dancing Ledge before sundown and not being able to see us and not remembering the way back to the bus Calum had walked all the way into Swanage town and was currently sheltering in “Fun Land”. The other members were relieved at the news of his safety and proceeded to pick him up and head back to Murray’s house for dinner.\nDay 2 After the adventures of day 1 it was decided that everyone would stick together and go bouldering in Portland. After a drive over to the isle and the navigational nightmare of the local streets designed to keep the locals off the mainland we arrived to a cold windy crag. The bouldering was made very difficult by the cold and not many hard things were climbed but everyone had a go. The bus thermometer told us that the temperature was -1.2 Co which was disputed by Calum as the mud on the floor and the sea were not frozen. At the end of the day everyone packed up and got on the minibus back to London making good time as Swanage is only 2.5 hours away.\nThe day was not quite over for Ali and Murray who had to spend quite some time driving around London looking for diesel as all the shell garages were shut. Time was also spent performing 3 point turns and parallel parking the minibus in its home behind the SAF.\n","date":"2010-10-01T00:00:00Z","image":"YAYAYA/YAYAYA/YAYAYA/p/swanage-2010/images/0_hu_b828202ef19494eb.jpg","permalink":"YAYAYA/p/swanage-2010/","title":"Swanage 2010"},{"content":"Attendees Joe Prinold Thomas Coyne Alwyn Elliott Lisa Alhadeff Alex Skinner Daniel Boocock Edward Poore Day 1 Although each of the seven tour members were departing from different locations about the country, everyone managed to get to Gloucester for around 1pm on the 2nd January. From here we packed up the cars and headed off to North Wales and the St Mary’s hut. The roads were fairly icy and snowy and so going was fairly slow. However, everyone managed to arrive at the hut around 8pm. A fire was started as quickly as possible to heat up the ice cold hut!\nDay 2 The first day of climbing and the group split into two with Al, Lisa, Alex and Ed heading off to explore the local trad crags, while Danny, Tom and Joe drove up to the much famed ‘cave of justice’. Although there had been some rain and snow the days before both groups had good dry rock and lots of good climbing was done.\nDay 3 Conditions were a bit dryer the next day and everyone headed off to a nearby crag to try some multi-pitch climbing. That is after the hour or so of pushing the cars up the snowy and icy track outside the hut, with the landrover racing ahead! After a good while scrambling around and discussing (or arguing?!) where the routes started everyone managed to get going. For Lisa and Alex this was their first multi-pitch experience and they coped very well with Lisa leading the final pitch of her climb. After everyone was down in one piece Al and Joe decided that with an hour of sun left they would attempt another route. What at first looked like a route in fact turned into a gardening expedition! However, only one piece of gear was lost and both returned down in one piece, albeit in the darkness.\nDay 4 Rain hit overnight and so it was decided that bouldering was the safest option. A quick drive to Llanberis pass revealed the boulder field snowed under. That’s when the mayhem began. Snowballs began flying from every direction as climbers found cover behind the problems they were planning on attempting. Some beautiful head shots were achieved by throwing blind over cover until Ed returned with lunch in the Landrover. The decision was then made to drive to a fairly far off crag on the coast where it was hoped that the weather would be better. It wasn’t! Still some of the beginners managed to get their first experience of bouldering in the snow and a couple of the older members had a nice swim in the sea!\nLisa and Alex left this evening\nDay 5 Again conditions were better and everyone headed off together. The first problem struck when Danny realized he was driving on a flat tyre! So the tyre was replaced and we headed back to the hut. Then on our way back out Al’s car came a cropper on the ice and one tyre was slashed! With two cars hobbling we decided to head to the nearest city and replace all the damaged wheels. With lots of frustrated climbers itching to get on some rock it was decided to go back to Parisella’s cave and attempt some night bouldering! This worked great with a land rover parked facing the crag with the lights on and some excellent climbing was had. After getting home to the hut the traditional roast dinner was started\u0026hellip; four hours later at about midnight dinner was served! After everyone had woken up and eaten, a fair system was implemented to decide whom should wash up – the loser of a game of forks. The president, Tom was so keen to avoid the washing up, that he stabbed Al with the fork in order to ensure his safety from the greasy pans. Finally everyone went to bed tired but cheerful.\nDay 6 On the final day we decided to try and get some more climbing done in the morning and headed to the local bouldering area in the Llanberis pass. Most boulders were topped with snow but a few bits were under cover and some decent climbing was had by all. Then we all headed home and everyone got back without incident.\nIn conclusion, the tour was a success. No fundamental changes to the trip organisation are recommended although perhaps a greater appreciation of the weather conditions could have been useful, both in the areas of travel as well as climbing conditions.\nFinancially, the trip made a marginal profit (£7!). We spent no money on accommodation, we spent £259 on food and a total of £250 on petrol. We received £167 in grants from the union and changed £50 for the trip\nClimbing was done every day and an excellent time was had by all.\n","date":"2010-01-02T00:00:00Z","permalink":"YAYAYA/p/winter-tour-2010/","title":"Winter Tour 2010"},{"content":"Members who attended Alistair Brash Simon Partridge Tom Coyne Brigette Atkins Joergen Myrtroeen Ed Poore Charlene Lawton Lizzie Wilkins Jacob Dean Jonathan Hazell Day 1 Despite the 10 tour members departing from different airports throughout the country everyone arrived in Alicante Airport, Spain at roughly the same time (varying between 09:30am and 11am local time). The first port of call was the car rental station where two hire cars were collected. One being upgraded two stages for free because they didn\u0026rsquo;t have the booked car, thus providing us with a 7-seater, dubbed the \u0026ldquo;win-car\u0026rdquo; for the rest of the tour.\nA (theoretical) hour later with some exploration of the Spanish coast led to everyone arriving in the first villa of the stay, graciously provided by Joergen. Unloading and lunch ensued then reloading into the cars and off to the beach to find one of the deep-water-soloing crags mentioned in the guide-books. After some non-existent right-turns eventually an alternative was found and the fun began.\nFor many of our members this was the first time they had been deep-water-soloing, climbing without ropes above the sea, the day ended with a spot of tombstoning from the top of the cliff.\nDay 2 We traveled the short journey down the coast to Sierra de Toix to climb at a place called Toix TV. After spending thirty minutes driving around the maze of holiday homes, we finally reached the crag as it began to pour with rain. Climbing began, regardless, with several routes being lead including a 7a (very hard!) lead by Joergen. After this, Tom set off on a route –accessed via a dodgy rope bridge - but ended up climbing past the lower-off, resulting in a run out traverse and a scramble to safety!\nDay 3 We set off to Forrada in search of some quality climbing. Four hours later, after driving through continuous hairpins, we reached a track described in the guide book as “rough in places”. This was discovered to be something of an understatement!\nThe climbing at Forrada was fantastic and turned out to be well worth the journey. At least it was until the monsoon arrived and forced us to shelter in a cave for the next hour, waiting for the rock to dry. The heavy downpour turned out to be a daily occurrence and always coincided with Brigette being stranded halfway up a lead. Joergen and Jacob managed to find some more difficult climbing in an area sheltered from the storm. One particular route (Starman, 7a+) provided them with conversation for the rest of the week. The journey back to the villa that evening was considerably shorter due to the saturated soil which allowed us to ‘mud-plane’ back down the track from the crag.\nDay 4 We headed back to the Sierra de Toix region but this time to Toix Ouest. Once again it rained in the afternoon (there is a theme here) so we went back to the villa for lunch. The plan for the afternoon was to head a short distance from the villa to Echo Valley. Unfortunately we got lost and drove half an hour into the valleys, ending up at a place that wasn’t in the guide book but did come recommended by a woman in stripy yellow trousers (clearly a climber). The boulderers among the group made friends with a local man-of -the-crag who showed them the best traverse in the area whilst chain smoking.\nDay 5 After the antics of the previous three days, it was decided we should take a rest day. We had a lazy morning by the pool followed by some deep water soloing in the afternoon. It was warmer in the sea than out, so we swam about before coming home.\nDay 6 This was our first trip to Sella (the biggest crag in the area) and we were not disappointed. The routes were amazing. Tom and Brigette started a multipitch but true to form, when Brigette’s involved, it began to rain as soon as they had both reached the first belay. After much commotion and a variety of problems, they both abseiled down to safety. Meanwhile, diehard boulderer, Jacob gets his head for heights as he takes his first fall whilst leading (after much bullying from Alistair and Joergen).\nFresher took a less active approach to the day and made a hammock at the base of the crag. His creativity got the better of him later in the day when he attempted to make a zip line into the swimming pool back at the villa. Fail.\nDay 7 We went to Echo Playa and for the first time since the first day, the sun was out. Quickly, we realized that it was too hot and hoped for mild temperatures once again!\nSome of us went off to do ‘traditional’ climbing, whilst the others climbed sport routes. By lunch time everyone was far too hot, so we decided to go back to the villa for a siesta.\nIn the afternoon, Fresher had a brilliant idea: He built a raft from water bottles and set sail in the swimming pool. However, his success was short lived as Tom and Jacob bombed him, sinking his raft!\nThat night, we moved to a villa in the mountains. Whilst everyone was packing, Fresher managed to put a large dent in the car. However, he did fix it with his trusty plunger.\nDay 8 Jacob, Alistair and Joergen climbed a three pitch route. Joergen, however, left his shoes at home, so they ended up sharing two pairs between three people, swapping shoes for each pitch. In the meantime, Charlene and Simon completed their first lead.\nThat evening ICMC stormed Benidom! We saw the delights that were on offer, Sticky Vicki, The Mediteraneun Bar to name but two\u0026hellip; We opted for the beach. Simon and the girls somehow ended up in the sea, partly clothed and Fresher got buried. ICMC returned home, distinctly weter and sandier than before and settled down for a nice bowl of carrot curry.\nDay 9 Back to Sierra de Toix again! Spurred on by the previous days multipitch, Fresher, Simon and Brigette set off on a three pitch excursion. Charlene climbed a route with a rope that was too short to be lowered off, so had to do some imaginative maneuvers to get down!\nBy this stage everyone else was bored with Toix and decided to do some more deep-water-soloing, leaving Fresher and co halfway up their multipitch.\nDay 10 This was our last full day of climbing, so we decided to go back to Sella as it was so good before. Tom and Ed managed to complete the multipitch that they got rained off last time. Charlene and Simon continued to tick off a number of lead climbs.\nDuring late afternoon, there was a massive downpour which resulted in half the group running for cover and leaving everyone else to pack up all the gear.\nDay 11 The last day! The weather was worse than ever, it was raining when we woke up! We packed and cleaned the house before driving towards Alicante. When we got there it was far too wet to sit on the beach, so what would a group of university students do in Alicante for a day? Obviously we found the nearest Toys ’R’Us and set about trying to play with every toy in the shop!\nIn conclusion, the tour went very well. I would not have made any fundamental changes to the way it ran, things that could be improved in the future are small organizational things such as being better at buying the correct amount of food for a large number of people. Financially, the tour broke even. And a good time was had by all! The only thing that did not go as planned was the fact that it rained so often! But that being said, we went climbing every day and still had an amazing time.\n","date":"2009-09-12T00:00:00Z","image":"YAYAYA/YAYAYA/YAYAYA/p/summer-tour-2009/images/0_hu_873da5a4da3b20d2.jpg","permalink":"YAYAYA/p/summer-tour-2009/","title":"Summer Tour 2009"},{"content":"By Dave Robinson Image credits - Sean Kelly @ UKC\nThis fortnight the ICMC headed of to Snowdonia for its shits and giggles. We stayed in the palatial hut owned by the University. A wood fire, kitchen and comfy mattresses meant we felt spoilt after the long journey from London.\nIt was super icy cold on the first day and the weather forecast had suggested that it might rain later, so there was a nervous decision on how to spend the day. In the end, we agreed to split up into two groups: one small group went multi-pitching, and one larger group went off scrambling (a middle ground between trekking and easier climbing).\nThe multi-pitchers\u0026rsquo; went off confidently but wandered too far and missed the climbing routes. With a quick change of mind, they opted to head for the summit instead. On the way up, Marcus and others made snowmen whilst Laurence got naked many times, just to keep spirits high. Eventually though, the weather got the better of them and they chose to turn back before Jack Frost hit too hard.\nThe scramblers bounded off to try a steep route up the East side of Tryfan. The misty fog that quickly developed blocked the view but gave the scrambling a creepy, eerie feel. We soon got to the top, more-or-less as planned (despite nobody spotting the \u0026ldquo;cannon-shaped\u0026rdquo; rock that was meant to guide our way) and started on our route down. Unfortunately, this was less uneventful as we couldn\u0026rsquo;t find the magical (simple) path that the map had been promising and ended up bodging our way down instead. It soon got dark and bodging became more difficult. After several hours of fumbling about in the dark we emerged from the marsh at the bottom of the mountain with a strong craving for a warm hut and some beer.\nOn the second day, those of us that still had the energy (and dry-ish clothes) went out trekking again, this time up Snowdon. Snowdon was gorgeous. We ended up crawling (quite literally in some cases) across a ridge that divided two huge drops and then trekking through foot high snow in sharp icy winds (all to the jolly soundtrack of Marcus\u0026rsquo;s whistling and singing). Well cool! The famous cafe at the top was very predictably shut but, after a slightly sheltered stop for food and water, we headed off back down along the easier \u0026ldquo;old granny\u0026rdquo; route. The easier route allowed us to appreciate the view a little more (whilst skidding about in the snow) and we were quickly down and into the minivan before dark set in.\nThe others went to a local indoor wall (The Beacon) for short while and then turned a quick pub lunch into a day trip of alcoholic endeavour.\n","date":"2005-01-01T00:00:00Z","image":"YAYAYA/YAYAYA/YAYAYA/p/snowdonia-trip-report-2005/cover_hu_9456f44add612c10.jpg","permalink":"YAYAYA/p/snowdonia-trip-report-2005/","title":"Snowdonia trip report 2005"},{"content":"Expedition report\nTeam members Charlotte Krishek Peter Rhodes Varalika Jain Dara Vakili Stuart McClune Benjamin Warmington Martha Gutteridge Jacob Mitchell Benjamin Jones Jon Urquidi Ferreira ","date":"2003-07-01T00:00:00Z","permalink":"YAYAYA/p/bolivia-expedition-2019/","title":"Bolivia Expedition 2019"},{"content":"Expedition report\n","date":"2003-07-01T00:00:00Z","image":"YAYAYA/YAYAYA/YAYAYA/p/kenya-expedition-2003/cover_hu_908c08300ebbdf04.png","permalink":"YAYAYA/p/kenya-expedition-2003/","title":"Kenya Expedition 2003"},{"content":"Expedition report\n","date":"2003-07-01T00:00:00Z","image":"YAYAYA/YAYAYA/YAYAYA/p/makalu-expedition-2003/cover_hu_109b2c5020f6d75e.png","permalink":"YAYAYA/p/makalu-expedition-2003/","title":"Makalu Expedition 2003"},{"content":"Expedition report\n","date":"2003-07-01T00:00:00Z","image":"YAYAYA/YAYAYA/YAYAYA/p/tibet-expedition-2005/cover_hu_7fcab0e238e2e683.png","permalink":"YAYAYA/p/tibet-expedition-2005/","title":"Tibet Expedition 2005"},{"content":"Expedition report\n","date":"2002-07-01T00:00:00Z","image":"YAYAYA/YAYAYA/YAYAYA/p/apolobamba-expedition-2002/cover_hu_5575aa3ed5a9c460.png","permalink":"YAYAYA/p/apolobamba-expedition-2002/","title":"Apolobamba Expedition 2002"},{"content":"Expedition report\n","date":"2001-11-01T00:00:00Z","permalink":"YAYAYA/p/pakistan-expedition-2001/","title":"Pakistan expedition 2001"},{"content":"Expedition report\nExpedition website\n","date":"2001-11-01T00:00:00Z","permalink":"YAYAYA/p/tagne-expedition-2001/","title":"Tagne expedition 2001"},{"content":"Expedition report\n\u0026ldquo;Forget your hands. Trust your shoes\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; The climbing shoe advert comes back to me as I balance awkwardly on the rockface, a hundred and twenty feet above the valley floor. If I were more comfortable, I could look behind me to see the towering limestone cliffs on the other side of the pass that forms the entrance to El Potrero Chico, Nuevo Leon, Mexico. To my left, the mountains a mile or two away are still shrouded in haze, but the sun is just peeking over the hills behind me.\nMy feet are on two small ledges, enough to hold me but far from reassuring. My left thumb and right forefinger are buried deep within small pockets around chest height, and the rest of my fingers are clinging to the smooth rock, more for psychological than physical support. In the back of my mind, though, is the vague thought that if my feet slip, I could break both digits quite easily.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s what I hope is a big hold is about four feet above me, and I should be able to clip into the next bolt when I reach it. But I\u0026rsquo;m already five feet above the last bolt, which will catch the rope if I fall, and there\u0026rsquo;s enough slack to ensure that I\u0026rsquo;ll drop about twelve feet before swinging into the rock. Even on \u0026lsquo;safe\u0026rsquo; sports climbs, where the bolt is permanently fixed into the rock, I\u0026rsquo;ve never quite got over my fear of falling. As I feel my arms tiring, I try not to imagine the scraping impact onto the sharp, water-shaped stone. Why didn\u0026rsquo;t I wear a long-sleeved top, despite the thirty-degree heat?\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been stood here for perhaps fifteen minutes, trying to figure out how to make the next moves. My feet are throbbing, and I shift position slightly, looking for better holds. These rock boots are tight at the best of times and the heat here is making my feet swell, so that taking them off is blissful relief. But I\u0026rsquo;m glad of the friction that\u0026rsquo;s keeping me on the rock. There\u0026rsquo;s a hint of a pocket about eight inches above my left foot. I plant my toe into it and stand up, scrabbling for any slight purchase with my right. Pulling hard on my right finger, I pull out my left thumb and reach up, curling the tips of my fingers over the illusion of a ledge, then bring my right foot up to a sloping hold underneath my hand. I\u0026rsquo;m off-balance now, and my left hand aches as I cling to the hold, carefully extract my right index finger and reach up for something more positive. My short stature is suddenly a blessing as I rock my weight onto my right foot, leg folded beneath me, pull myself over the slight bulge and gasp with relief as I sink my left hand into the hold I\u0026rsquo;d seen earlier, mercifully deep enough to hang from. After a moment\u0026rsquo;s pause to catch my breath and clip my rope to the bolt, I move on – my position isn\u0026rsquo;t quite comfortable enough to actually rest. The sun\u0026rsquo;s out properly now, and I can feel the back of my neck warming up. I go through similar moments of\nanguish twice more before I reach the top of the route and relax. I can just summon the energy to smile in weary achievement before I head back down.\nNow, repeat that entire process two, three or more times a day for three weeks (apart from when it rains, at which point the rock turns dangerously slick). Add in basic but pleasant camping, spectacular scenery, spicy food, cold beer, linguistic difficulties, a limited supply of books and many, many games of Hearts, and you\u0026rsquo;re not too far away from a climbing expedition. In this case, we were in Mexico, so our list of pleasures also included tequila, aggressive invertebrates and cacti. Big, spiky, painful cacti that infested the higher slopes – but more of them later.\nSound like fun? It should be pointed out that rock climbers are a strange breed, and the Imperial College Mountaineering Club are stranger than most (we are Imperial students, after all). Unless you\u0026rsquo;ve tried it, there\u0026rsquo;s no way that I can convince you that good climbing makes all incidental hardships fade into the background, and the inherent risk only adds to the exhilaration.\nAnd the climbing was great. El Potrero Chico is a ring of limestone peaks, thrust up among the Sierra Madre Oriental, a few miles down the road from Monterrey, Mexico\u0026rsquo;s third city and industrial heartland. The northern edge of the Potrero (Spanish for corral – a ring of mountains) is split by a steep-sided pass, where most of the existing climbing has been done. Vast slabs of limestone, hundreds of feet high and ranked like sharks teeth, form small valleys and canyons on both sides of the pass. There are literally hundreds of routes on the various rock faces, and their varied orientations mean that even in the fierce afternoon sun, there\u0026rsquo;s always something in the shade. The rock itself is mainly hard carbonates, especially limestone, and is covered with cracks, pockets, flakes and imperfections that make for varied and challenging climbing. Best of all, the surface of the rock is rough, without the \u0026lsquo;polished\u0026rsquo; feel of more popular areas.\nWith financial help from the Imperial College Exploration Board and the University of London Union, nine students set off on the long flight to Mexico City at the start of September. Our mission: to develop new routes in one of the world\u0026rsquo;s most exciting climbing areas.\nMexico City is impossibly huge, and located in arguably the worst possible place to put twenty million people. On a high plateau, surrounded by a ring of volcanoes (some of which are still active), the city\u0026rsquo;s air is a thick smog of exhaust fumes from its crowded streets and heavy industry. There\u0026rsquo;s little in the way of a sewer system, and the whole place stinks. It may be a lively, vibrant\nmetropolis, but we left without regret on an overnight bus for the long journey north to Monterrey.\nAlthough Monterrey turned out to be fairly nice, we wasted little time there, making instead for the town of Hidalgo and El Potrero Chico. We spent much of our time staying at the Rancho Cerro Gordo, a campsite ten minutes walk outside the Potrero that catered to the growing numbers of climbers who come from all over the world to visit the area. The ranch was quiet – September is just outside the peak winter season – so we more or less took over the tin-roofed pavilion, where the traditional shower block and kitchen area were joined by some old sofas, a pull-up bar and a tightrope. There were a couple of spare helmets we could borrow, too.\nThe ranch was to become our base for the rest of our time there, but we spent a few nights camping in the Potrero, looking for new crags to develop. We all spent the next two weeks there, before some people drifted off to see more of the country, specifically the Pacific coast. After the bustle and grime of the cities, it was great to be out in the country. People were friendly and relaxed, living was easy, if not spectacularly cheap, and the rock was gorgeous. Even the events of September 11th seemed a world away – our only contact with the outside world was a Texan radio station and the occasional trip into Monterrey for a cybercafe.\nAfter a few days acclimatising to the heat and remembering how to climb, we set off into the wilderness to look for new routes. We camped at the opposite side of the Potrero from the pass, and set out in small groups to find fresh, unconquered rock. Unfortunately, it looked like said rock was going to remain unconquered for a while longer. Despite several trips into the bush, towards the tantalising rock faces we could see in the distance, we never quite managed to find anything.\nThe problems were twofold. For starters, the approaches to the actual rock were up steep slopes, covered with vegetation. While this was not at first a problem, the higher we went, the more cacti we found. I used to think that cacti looked quite nice, but I now regard them with the kind of venomous hatred usually reserved for the Student Loans Company. Fighting every step of your way up an often loose slope, and being repeatedly impaled on sharp thorns which are thrust at you from every direction is not my idea of a pleasant walk in the desert. Clearing a path wasn\u0026rsquo;t an option either – uprooting cacti is illegal in Mexico. We eventually decided that the pain and blood loss were too severe, especially since no-one in their right mind would want to make their own way up to repeat any routes we did manage.\nThe other trouble was the rock. We had decided before we left to avoid drilling into the rock to\nplace bolts, so would be relying on \u0026rsquo;traditional\u0026rsquo;, hand-placed protection. Although riskier, this avoids leaving unsightly metal bolts in the rock face, and is generally preferred in Britain. Unfortunately, limestone does not always lend itself to such practices, and we found few possible lines which would be safe to climb. A further problem was that the rock was quite loose in places, and had various plants growing in it elsewhere. At the start of one potential route, the first hold came away as soon as it was tried. On reflection, we decided that our initial plan was not feasible, and since we had no bolting equipment to set up sports routes we resigned ourselves to enjoying the climbs already there.\nThose climbs were spectacular, though. As well as scores of short routes, the Potrero has spectacular long routes, which can take an entire day to get up and down. One of these is Yankee Clipper, which climbs up almost a thousand feet to a summit on the west side of the pass. Our glorious leaders, club President Kevin and Vice President Phil had three attempts on this monster – twice, they were forced by darkness and rain to abseil down from about halfway. Other memorable experiences included a rope getting stuck two hundred feet up in the dark, and a thunderstorm that flooded our sleeping area at one in the morning. We left the Potrero with mixed feelings. It was a shame to travel halfway across the world and not achieve our main goal, but we\u0026rsquo;d had a great time, and the experience of fantastic climbing in a new country had been great. Given the opportunity, I\u0026rsquo;d go back there, but unless you happen to live in the States it\u0026rsquo;s a long, long way to get there. But the people are nice, the rock\u0026rsquo;s great and Mexico\u0026rsquo;s pretty civilised by South American standards, so it\u0026rsquo;s well worth considering.

Not the combination expected, well climbing on slate in the Lake District was the plan; the sunshine was an added extra. Despite much debate on the way up north, the intended induction into \u0026lsquo;Hollies\u0026rsquo; was missed due to no-one being sure where it was, until it was decided we had missed it, so Burger King had to suffice.\nEventually we reached the Hut. The good thing about Huts/Barns, (or any permanent structure with four walls and a roof…apart from saving the hassle of blundering around in the dark putting tents up. (why are torches always at the bottom of the bag) is the better facilities, often mattresses as opposed to hard ground, and basic cooking facilities. The other advantage is decent toilets especially according to one member who when going to the loo asked \u0026lsquo;can I have a torch as I can\u0026rsquo;t see shit in the toilet\u0026rsquo; apparently he meant that he was having difficulty finding the light switch.\nSaturday started as usual with those first awake eventually facing everybody to get a move on, but where? The previous nights plans of early morning climbs were lost, as we departed for Keswick and a tea shop, followed by finding lunch at the bakery next door as the sandwiches we had each bought did not compare to the pasties and buns on offer.\nThe crag on the first day had a good slab, for the more recent converts to outdoors climbing to use their new gear from a recent \u0026lsquo;cheap gear day\u0026rsquo;. Whilst for those more experienced there were more challenging routes as well. The crag also had the rare distinction of being sheltered at the bottom, and in bright sunlight at the top. You cannot beat that! Coupled with the views down the valley to snow capped mountains. The days climbing was only curtailed by the loss of light, so we decamped to Keswick, and the chip shop, for tea.\nA pub a short walk from the hut provided the evening\u0026rsquo;s entertainment, with what can only be described as a comprehensive selection of whiskeys on view, for those who wanted to try something different. The room at the hut continued to provide amusement, the roof beam providing a further challenge, as all comers failed to, from hanging underneath, go round over the top of the beam.\nSunday initially provided more of the same again starting with a (regulation?) tea room and bakery visit, and then moving on to the Bowder Stone, a huge bolder deposited by glaciers, and providing problems for those who wanted something different. The crag on the way to the boulder offered a variety of routes, which kept us amused all day. The day again finished as it got dark, and so began the long journey south back to the smoke. However a treat was in store. This time the deliberation started early enough that we managed to find Hollies transport cafe, for the culinary experience of the trip. Better by far even than bargain deals of 12 pasties for price of 10, or even teacakes and hot-cross buns. The service may not have been with a smile, but the servings were big, and cheap. We soon replaced any fat we had burnt off over the weekend, some even thinking a mixed grill was justified.\n","date":"2000-01-01T00:00:00Z","permalink":"YAYAYA/p/diary-of-a-trip-to-the-lakes/","title":"Diary of a trip to the Lakes"},{"content":"Author unknown.\nAt first thought, it all seems rather mad: piling into a minibus on a cold Friday night, bombing up the M1 for a couple of hours and then wandering into a field, at midnight, with a torch as your only light source in which to pitch a tent! Okay, so it is mad, but why not? Oh, and the reason for this?\nTo get two awesome days, climbing the gritstone crags of the Peak District. As a relative novice to the world of rock climbing, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t quite sure what to expect, but just the thought of leaving London for the weekend was reason enough to go.\nWaking up on Saturday morning to the sound of whistling birds rather than rush-hour traffic, with the crag only a few minutes away, I was convinced I had made the right decision! With all the banter from more experienced club members about past triumphs and plans for the day, I wondered if it would be possible to climb anything without looking totally pathetic. The skill of these people, however, means that one is able to develop at their own pace in a relaxed and safe environment.\nWe were very lucky as there was no rain all weekend, with the added bonus of sun on Sunday, making those first moves even more enjoyable! Returning to London on Sunday night, I felt refreshed, albeit tired, and ready to take on those 9am lectures! It was certainly one of the best weekends I\u0026rsquo;ve had in two years of being at Imperial.\nAs well as these trips, which are run every other weekend, the club visits a London climbing wall every Wednesday. This is where I did my first climb, and although outdoor climbing is a different game to wall climbing, it is an excellent way of seeing what climbing is all about, without the commitment of a whole weekend away. Climbing walls also help you to improve your technique, whether you decide to go outdoors or not. So, you feel like having a go? Then just turn up and come along. We meet at the college climbing wall* (off the walkway, next to STA Travel) on Wednesdays at 1pm. All you need is yourself (well, and about ten quid!) By about 6pm we tend to leave the wall and head for a pub somewhere around college for an evening of chatting and relaxation.

A collection of alcoholics watching an evening of British cinema including The Italian Job\u0026rsquo; and Monty Python\u0026rsquo;s .and now for something completely different. This unbounded of Stupidity was to set the atmosphere for the entire holidav. A Taxi ride at breakneck speed in the wee small hours took us to Gatwick airport. where the more enthusiastic of us raced in luggage trolleys across the deserted terminal. A plane and a train later we found ourselves in El Chorro (the centre of nownere) onlv to tind an automobile driver I by our gracious host, and rally-driver wannabie Jean, ready to take us further away tron anvwhere. The climbing started immediately (although some more relaxed members of the club decided that they wanted to acclimatise to the nice weather betore doing anything too strenuous, 1e sunbathing). El Chorro is a small town on the train line between Malaga and Seville and is a popular venue for climbers from all around Europe. The gorge (through which the train line winds its way) provides varied routes of all grades for beginners and hard-core climbers alike. with routes anvwhere from 20ft to 400ft in length. In addition to climbing, the surrounding hills are excellent for mountain biking. A 70 vear old steel cable, stretchina diagonallv across the gorge provided entertainment and photo opportunities as thre members of the club travelled across (at this point please bear in mind that the cable is over 100m above a white-water river and is 150m long). Surprisingly enough there were no serious casualties during the trip, (and all of the minor injuries seemed to be focused on James a rock fell on me\u0026rsquo; Philips). Our honoured treasurer did some rather impressive shit, and we all cheered. He also fell off, and we cheered again and threw beans at him Arguably the most epic climb of the trip was a route named El Amptrax, graded French 6a (where 8c is about the hardest climbable). Amptrax was a route that went up the highest part of the rock and took the entire day for two pairs of climbers to complete, and included a dramatic overhang on the final pitch Not all Of our time was spent being macho, tanned, hard-bodj types. We also spent some time walking in the hills absorbing the beautifu scenery (yean right), as well as swimming naked in the reservoir just north of the upper gorge (no seriously we did, apart form the naked bit, I lied about that) / and the bar, Ed. J. At this point I would like to say that Belay bunny only had chips (SOrry a personal joke, It\u0026rsquo;s very tunny, trust me). Al the end or the week we were loath to leave, but with shortening tunas and looming exams we returned home, with improved personal bests and some nice tans.\nLes alpes: Sam\u0026rsquo;s epic Quite a few people managed to get out to the Alps this summer (Graham, Ian, James, sJam Myself and others/ completing many routes despite the appalling weather experienced. The most notable assents being the Tour Noir, Aig. L\u0026rsquo;M and the Aig. De Perseverance. With such a large number of climbs completed the reports from the Alps could have potentially filled the entire journal, so I had to restrict the number of entries to a single arucie. My reason for choosing this over other potential candidates is simply that it was an epic. It also nappened to De the same route that the du anoteep the quotes section. / came trom 2 weeks later when they followed me up the route. ha. ha. ha. So over to Sam\u0026hellip; Finally! The weather forecast from the \u0026ldquo;Office de Haute Montagne\u0026rdquo; in Chamonix, predicted a Clear sunny day. Vur chance had come to do a route on the Aiguille de I\u0026rsquo;M. My climbing partner, Ben and I set off early from the campsite to catch the cable car from the town at 7am to reach the Plan du \u0026lsquo;Aiguille. We had decided to do a relatively low route (a maximum altitude of 2844m) to avoid the snow that had built up, but there was still up to a foot of snow on the lower slopes. We trekked for two hours across small snowfields and glacial moraine. The route we had planned to do had a bit of snow and ice on it and looked very bad. We had crampons and ice axes with us, but w decided to do an easier route which Should be in better condition with more sun facing it. After another trek we finally began climbing the NNE ridge of the M. The route was better, but still had snow coverer ledges, and climbing in rock shoes made getting over these difficult. A couple of other climbers started to follow us up, and they turned out to be British. The first pitches of the climb were alright, but they began to get harder. We soon reached a large ledge which had lots of snow on it, and I got my feet cold and wet. The next pitch was a small chimner but it had ice on the inside, which made it difficult to gel up. Ben lead the ditch and I managed to scramble un it By the time I reached the top I was thoroughly tired, anc the weather Was Star ung to close in. I was temnted to call it a day and abseil off, but we decided it should be easier to Keep going to the top, and find the easy walk ont from there. we could see the English couple were struggling. but persevering. We continued to the ton, and now the clouds had come in and it was starting to snow. It was also getting late and we were in danger of missing the last cable car down. Finally we reached the top and coulc nardlv see a counle of metres in front of us Worse still we couldn\u0026rsquo;t find the route off the top, as there was so much snow, and it looked too dangerous to try We were soon joined by the other climbers, Roger and Michelle (trom Barnsley), who were alsc very tired and unsure of the \u0026lsquo;walk out\u0026rsquo; route. Ben and I decided to abseil off the way we had climbed up, as at least we knew the way. The chance of us catching the cable car was now very slim. We had onlv: single 50m rope with us so it would take several abseils to get down. We had to leave bits of sling and cord behind tied around spikes to thread the rope through. We saw the others following us down, but they were using two 50m ropes tied together. We reached the large ledge about a third of the way down, when we heard shouts from above. We stopped and looked up to see Michelle shouting down to us that they had got their ropes jammed, anC couldn\u0026rsquo;t budge them. Roger was trying to free them but without any luck. He was about half way down hi. ropes and quite stuck. While we waited he managed to cut his rope and retie it to abseil dowr ) where Michelle was waiting. They managed to absell and scramble down to where we were waiting. They only had two pieces of rope left, about one third of their original length. It was starting to get dark now, and was still snowing. The four of us abseiled down our rope off the rest of the mountain. By the time we reached the base, it was black and we had missed the cable car down by hours. There was nothing for it but to walk down to the valley, 1500m below us. We only had a few torches with us, and the ground was very difficult with snow to start with leading onto the glacial moraine, large lumps of granite which are hard to cross. After several hours wt managed to find a path which eventually led to a track through the forest. We were all extremely exhausted and stumbling along these rough tracks, often tripping up over rocks and roots. Our torch batteries were beginning to fade. We kept on going, even though I was tempted just to find a nice bush and go to sleep under it. We could see the town lights, but they never seemed to get closer. At 2am We finally reached the campsite and just flopped into bed.\nBy Sam Downer.\nIreland: sea stacks, don\u0026rsquo;t jump Having conquered the Alps a couple of weeks previously, the Spacevan then travelled off to SW Ireland with Graham and I in it. Having bored the f*ck out of Graham looking for my ancestral home in Cork, we finally managed to climb a handful of stunning pitches near Killarney in Cr Kerrv. Even though this part holds the highest mountain in Ireland (Carrantouhill), the amount of rock climbing is quite limited compared to the northern and eastern areas (e.g. Wicklow) - which I encourage vou to visit in the not too distant titure The highlight of the trip was when Graham almost killed himself jumping 18m off a sea stack. Soloing up the 30m high stack (about V Diff was nevertless superb. However, one morning whilst culturing around Dingle in Kerry, I discovered the true magic of freshly made Irish Soda Bread. I have recently discovered a scientific explanation for this magic - it 1: in the acidity of the buttermilk which reacts with the alkalinity of the soda making it rise even better! Grabam was not impressed - luckily he didn\u0026rsquo;t have to suffer this decadence as he had remembered to bring his own strange variety of bread all the way from the co-op in Devon\nBy James \u0026ldquo;NICE\u0026rdquo; Carter\nPostcard from Lyon: Graham Cooper on Tour Dear Club, being a keen student, I naturally took the opportunity of spending a year in France at a college in Lyon as to broaden my horizons and learn the French way of engineering. It had nothing to do witl the close proximity of the Alps and endless possibilities of routes on rock, snow and ice to explore. The mountaineering club in Lyon are a good crowd who I met at the year\u0026rsquo;s hirst pss up, and who then decided it would be a laugh to invite some English psshead, to do some climbing with them. The year started well with a few easy warm up peaks ( Pic de l\u0026rsquo;tendard, and the Alberon) which gave me chance to overcome some quite important communication difficulties. These routes were simple glacie: walks although a little steep in places for the Alberon. After that, before it got too cold we did one weekend of big rock routes in the Erins massif. this was one of the best weekends I\u0026rsquo;ve had this year and we did one route high up graded D, and one route the next day of 350m at a level around 6a, quoter ID/ID+. You hardcore nutter. Ed. I Unfortunately after that there were lots of parties so I stayed in Lyon. (Two coachloads of students spending a whole day visiting wine caves accompanied by a less than sober brass band being one Delore Christmas however, I did manage to spend 5 davs near Chamonix (Cluses\u0026rsquo; doing some big rock routes (not too high up because it was cold) and a weekend in the Calanques (set cliffs near Marseilles: reminded me of Devon) After Christmas the ice chimbing season begins. We are but mortal men, so interspersed with some climbing a group of us had a go at that to. By halt term we were getting quite reasonable and hadn'1 yet had any fatal injuries, but then one dark night while descending I tripped over and cut my finger. Fully recovered by half term I did a bit more including Chere Couloir on Mont Blanc du Tacul. /A route I car personally recommend, Ed./ Finally on the last day I did my first bit of vertical ice which was a cigar of about 10 meters followed by other smaller vertical passages. [NICE, Ed.] After that all the ice falls fell down, sometimes with people on them, so we stopped climbing them. Since half term I\u0026rsquo;ve done a few other things, some skung and ski trekking but what I really want to do is an approach on skis, then an iced up gully then decent on skis, but the weather hasn\u0026rsquo;t beer so that will have to walt. That\u0026rsquo;s about all. I hope you\u0026rsquo;ve had a cool year, and if any one wants to come out to the Alps al Easter or in the summer, I shall be there all the time. Hope you have a good dinner meet, (worms aren\u0026rsquo;t good for you).

The trip started with having our normal early hours arrival at thr Count House which was complete with regimented lines of drawing pins, and more rules than a nunnery. We emerged from our sleeping bags, later that morning (about 4 hours later to be precise) only tc realise that we had picked the one weekend in the entire Cornish winter that had seen any sun! The weather outside even managed to motivate Garth to emerge from his bag with less than the customar: seven thousand curses, insults and threats of death.

It was all going fine and I was about 2/3rds of the way up the crack when I saw the top and went for It. A purely instinctive reaction, two layback moves (now with a left leg thal wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have been out of place in an Elvis dance routine) later and I was covering some serious air miles.. One of my bits of gear decided that it didn\u0026quot; particularly like being in the rock, in fact it didn\u0026rsquo;t even like being on the rope and duly detached itself from it, the second held and I bounced on the rope about and inch or two below the belay ledge Remarkably lan managed to sustain the worst injury (I was fine) with a nice little burn mark across his belaying hand (cheers lan). After establishing that my left leg was now having problems sticking to the ground, let alone the rock (due to unwanted vibrations that a Union van would be proud of), I decided to ab. down later to get my bit of gear out.

The next day was spent in pretty much the same fashion as the first, with me getting my confidence back and everyone else basking in the second day of lovely sun.

The third pitch (out of condition) should have been a near vertical pitch in kind of broken chimney, ho ho ho what a joke.

This was followed by : small powder filled offwidth with an overhanging wall to the left trine to push vou onto a totally blant face on the right. How we laughed. tears in our eves.

After discovering that most of the tents had certain essential bits missing, we managed to erect some vaguely tent like tents and collapse into them only to be evicted in the morning by a pointy head with a dog which wanted to get into James bivvy bag with him! However it did get going nice and early, we were climbing at Sennen by about 9.30! Sennen was pretty nifty, the routes are quite hard and exposed for their grade. I did two HSs, on the first I had to place a bit of pro whilst using an undercut to reach over an overhang (then proceed lc pull over the overhang!!). On the second I had to swing out onto a large flake, hand traverse along it with smears for feet and then mantle shelf onto it - with no hand holds to pull on. Phoar, can 1 have your children? Ed. / It was excellent! I think I might go back in the summer cause it would be gorgeous without a force 10 gale!!

The site owner however was a old pointy headed female with the site itself not being much better. Since all the proper sites were shut however it was a pretty good, cheap place to camp, with a dub up the road. Sunday we went to Bosigran and while Daffy launched up Door post I sat about getting rained or by intermittent showers contemplating whether I could be arsed to climb a very slimy Ding. I decided I couldn\u0026rsquo;t and went for a hard core bimble (hard core since I was carving a 30-40 pound sack!!)/No excuse join S\u0026amp;G, Ed.I.

This, of course, caused the entire bas to suddenly be filled with parents and small children leaving me to run back to my bag (half way up the beach) in my wet boxers in front of a crowd Wembley would be proud of!! The others, by all accounts went bouldering in a cove round the corner. After that Alex did his Nigel Mansell impression and drove all the way back - getting us back before midnight\nBy Simon \u0026ldquo;fancy a sweaty little boy\u0026rdquo; Judge\nBaldric the sausage Once upon a time there was a little sausage named Baldric and he lived happily ever after.\nNicked by Rich Marr, dedicated to Simon Judge.\nSwanny \u0026lsquo;98 (13th-15th feb): NICE By far and away one of the best weekends despite a rather low turnout. Upon arriving in Lanator Matravers, we headed for a rendezvous with Sam in The King\u0026rsquo;s Arms. This turned out to be a counle o barrels of ale in someone\u0026rsquo;s living room, and we almost apologised for bursting into the landlord\u0026rsquo;s home before we realised it was the local pub. Our local guide arrived before closing time with the news that Old Tom\u0026rsquo;s Field was closed, so we set up for the night in Young Sam\u0026rsquo;s Lounge. This is a highly recommender camp site, but watch out for Sam\u0026rsquo;s chocolate logs. Many thanks to the wardens for the use of their well mamtamned faculties. The following morning we took the ferry across to Swanage, a surreal experience in the dense morning fog and eerily silent and calm waters. After breakfast at Ricky\u0026rsquo;s we checked out the local shop and agreed to meet back at the bus. As per tradition, we lost Al K and almost left him behind. We chose to go for the climbs at Winspit because they offered a good range of climbs in some fabulou: surroundings. Al P and I decided to try a well polished HVS 5b ammonite but by the end of the day it had managed to defeat all of us. Meanwhile Daffy tackled an excellent VS and Ruth, Sam and Al P had a go at some bolted E\u0026rsquo;s (blot wendies, Ed.] which were far too exciting. Cursing the bad design of ancient sea creatures, Al P and I went to try the trad routes by the sea but found them to be a bit wet (and there was : lot of water too). We returned to the Juarrvman\u0026rsquo;s Wall to nav on the bolted routes instead. At the end of the day Daffy lobbed fantastically on an HVS he was trying to lead, and Ruth and Al P found a trad route in the quarry that wasn\u0026rsquo;t apparently in the guide book, and promptly named it Lard Arse. As the night drew in we decided to head back into Swanage to find a pub. We encountered some particularly odd locais in The Anchor (even odder than us), and decided to hide from them in the back oi the pub. However they probably thought Ruth was pretty odd [and who wouldn\u0026rsquo;t, Ed.] when they heard her announce that she \u0026ldquo;alwavs noticed when it was in front of her. but didn\u0026rsquo;t notice it from behind\u0026rdquo; and that \u0026ldquo;doing it forwards is much worse that doing it backwards\u0026rdquo; - abselling of course. We decided to cros: quickly over to The Swan where we dined and danced the night away to the live music from the rocking and totally un-valentines band. Finally we staggered back up the hill to camp out under the glittering stars and sweeping bear of the lighthouse\u0026hellip; or on a log if Daffy had anything to do with putting up the tent! The next morning we arrived at the country park before the crack of dawn (So that\u0026rsquo;ll be Llish then? Ed.J. As the sun rose we knew we were in for a fabulous day at the Subluminal cliffs. Al K promptly established our presence at the cliffs by setting up the \u0026ldquo;Abseil Rope Of Doom\u0026rdquo; just east of the popular Balcony route. A number of friendly climbers who politely asked to make use of the rope were seen to struggle back up over the edge of the cliff a few hours later, in an obviously less friendly mood. The bottom of the abseil involved a lovely near-inverted, \u0026ldquo;don\u0026rsquo;t wanna break my skull\u0026rsquo;, free-fall finish fo added amusement factor - thanks Al. This provided excellent practice for those in the group (previously) not keen on the activity, and prepped us for some excellent climbs on possibly the best coastal crags in the country. The easier severe route Gangway provided valuable trad gear leading experience for both Daffy and myself. Later in the day we were joined by other members of ICMC. James took Megan on the climbs near face, and lan et al. disappeared to look for some nice hard routes /located in the pub perchance: Ed.J. Ruth, Daffy and Al P tried a mixed up combination of Highstreet and Bypass, and later Megan made a leisurely lead up the Highstreet (trust a woman to spend ages on the highstreet). When Al K and I got rudely blocked off an HS route by some other climbers we decided to take a break, but Daffy and Al F carried on by tackling first Corner. As the day came to its inevitable but unnecessary end, Ruth finishec off by leading Damo up Curving Crack and after Al K finished his billionth cigry and went to rescue the infamous ab rope. Of course, he managed to make another spectacular cock-up of the entire operation anc almost ended up taking a swim (sorry Al but it\u0026rsquo;s true)! He forgot his prusick (essential for ascending), anc we suspect he used fart power from the previous night\u0026rsquo;s Skull-ache bitter to get back un. Overall an entertaining day to round off a perfect trip. Many thanks to Al P for his excellent driving through the fog-scaped nights and WOCdt Woody for organising the trip (And the Banana Joke).

You can find the article (and the rest of this edition of Felix) in the link below:\nClick here to download\nAn expedition report from the Cordillera Real (Bolivian) expedition can also be found here: Click here to download\nThe two articles and their transcription can be found below:\nTranscription Bolivia Last summer, an eight-man expedition left Imperial College to climb in the Andes in Bolivia. Towards the end of the period spent climbing, two members of the expedition were killed whilst attempting a new climb on the east face of Illampu. They were Dave Steel, aged 24, who completed his degree in Electrical Engineering last year, and Rog Scull also aged 24. Dave was an active member of the College Moun taineering Club for several years, a rock climber of exceptional ability, who had several notable first and early ascents to his name, especially in the Avon Gorge area; he was also an experienced mountaineer with several successful Alpine seasons behind him. Rog was not a member of the college, but had been a close friend and usual climbing partner of Dave\u0026rsquo;s for many years, and was invited to take part in the expedition for his ability and experience as a mountaineer.\nCaucasus The IC Mountaineering Club sent an expedition to the Caucasus this summer. Its plans were to spend some six weeks climbing in the Caucasus mountains during July and August, but after a short time in Russia, it was realised that the local restrictions and controls placed upon the party in the mountains would prevent the group from achieving any significant climbs whatsoever. After two weeks, the members of the expedition decided to leave Russia and travel to the French Alps. The group had been in Chamonix for about ten days when the tragedy occurred.\nOn Saturday, 29th July, Graham Groarke and Keith Skelton left Chamonix for the Argentierre Hut about five miles up the valley from Chamonix. They planned to do two climbs from the hut, both popular and well frequented routes. The first on the Sunday was to be a route known as the ENE buttress and NE slope of Les Courtes. The second which they intended to climb on Monday was to have been a traverse of Le Tour Noir They were expected back at camp in Chamonix on Monday evening.\nThey did not return on Monday evening, but those left in camp were not unduly worried by their non-appearance. The weather had become cloudy during the afternoon, and it was assumed they were spending another night in the hut and would come down the following morning. The alarm was raised at 2 p.m. on Tuesday afternoon (1st August) when they had not arrived. The special high mountain branch of the police were notified. They telephoned the warden of the Argentierre hut, who said that Groarke and Skelton had left at 2 a.m. on Sunday morning to climb Les Courtes (3,800 m) and had not returned to the hut. The warden has assumed they were going on down the other side of the mountain to a different hut, the Couvercle, after completing their climb. He said that a French party had passed them about half way up the climb and reported that the two Englishmen were going well\u0026hellip; if a little slowly. The French party who had not \u0026lsquo;seen them again after passing them completed the climb and returned to the Argentierre Hut\u0026rsquo;. The Warden of the Couvercle Hut was then telephoned, and said that he had seen no sign of the pair. Both Wardens reported their areas in heavy mist. The police said that they would send their helicopter to search as soon as the mist cleared up a little.\nThe helicopter went up at first light on Wednesday morning. The bodies of Graham and Keith were found almost immediately at the foot of the ENE buttress of Les Courtes, and were brought down to Chamonix. It was judged that the pair had fallen a long way possibly from near the top of the climb which was 1,800 feet from start to finish. There was no obvious reason as to the cause of the accident. Both Keith and Graham were experienced climbers and the route was well within their capabilities. It is felt that the most likely explanation of the cause of the accident is that the pair had taken an unduly long time on the early rock section of the climb and found themselves on the upper snow field in the late afternoon when the snow was soft and unstable. It is almost impossible to belay or perform an ice axe arrest in soft wet snow. They would by then have been quite tired and one slip would have been enough to pull both ment from the face.\nWhatever happened, the loss of two good friends was a severe blow to the expedition and the Mountaineering Club.\nIt is through these stories that we must remember to face the mountain with respect and treasure the times we can spend with our friends. Watch out for your mates when you\u0026rsquo;re out on the mountain.

The main object was to get experience in high level camping on glaciers and snow fields and to get to know the other members of the team. For the first week one party of six did a high level traverse from Saas Fee to Zermatt via the Alphubeljock, Allalinpass and Adlerpass, several camps being only just short of the 4000 meter mark. Peaks climbed included the Allalinhom, Alphubel, Strahlhorn, Adlerhorn and Himpfischorn. The other party climbed from the Mischibel Hut on the Dom Leinspitze ridge but were severely hampered by deep snow.\nAt Zermatt we exchanged equipment and the camping party set off in the Monte Rosa area. They traversed under Lionte Rosa, along the frountier ridge and down to the Fluhalp and Zermatt, climbing on the way Castor, the traverse of Monte Rosa, Gimma de Jazzi, Strahlhorn and the Rimpfischhorn. The other party climbing from huts did a partial traverse of the Briethorn (not completed because of bad snow), Castor, Dom, and the first ascent of the Taschhorn that season.\nFor the third week we interchanged parties and all climbed from huts. Peaks climbed included the Zinal Rothorn, Obergablehorn, Matterhorn and an unsuccessful attempt was made on the Weisshorn. At the end of the week we met in Bri g railway station, all very happy, dirty and well sunburnt after a most successful alpine season.\n","date":"1956-07-01T00:00:00Z","permalink":"YAYAYA/p/switzerland-expedition-1956/","title":"Switzerland Expedition 1956"},{"content":"A compilation of the club\u0026rsquo;s history from 1929-1951 was found in the club archives (a.k.a Box of Doom).
